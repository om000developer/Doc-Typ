  "content": "Psychiatric Evaluation DOB : 05/03/1994 Date of evaluation: August 13, 2011  The patient was seen with his mother for a psychiatric evaluation.  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  The patient is a17 year old male who was previously living in a group home but recently moved back home with his parents.  He will be going into Grade 12 at .  REASON FOR REFERRAL:  Diagnostic clarification and psychiatric opinion.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by, Pediatrician.  The patient was referred as was requesting for diagnostic clarification and to inform the treatment plan.  The patient was diagnosed with ADHD combined type in 2004.  The patient was initially started on Concerta and it was titrated to 90 mg qam.  It was not optimal therefore in 2008, the patient was switched to Ritalin SR 20 mg tablets, one in the morning and one at lunch, along with Ritalin 10 mg tabs, one in the morning and 1-2 in the evening as needed.  It was in the summer of 2009 when he was caught smoking pot in his friend\u2019s home; the patient was switched to Adderall XR and remained on this until the winter of 2009-2010.  In late 2009, the patient had feelings of sadness and anxiety.  He was subsequently referred to in 2009. diagnosed patient with an anxiety disorder and depression.  had recommended that the patient have Zoloft titrated to 100 mg daily and also suggested decreasing the Adderall XR down to 30 mg.  However, the reduction of Adderall did not occur as patient and his mother were reluctant to change as Psychiatric Evaluation Re:  Liam Barro August 13, 2011 Page 2  patient was doing well on Adderall for his ADHD.   In mid April, 2010, the patient had good response to Zoloft making him much happier.  However, his grades started to decline again.  The patient was subsequently switched to Vyvanse to a high dosage along with Ritalin SR in the afternoon as needed.  In late 2010, the patient was seeing, a psychologist, regularly.  During that time he was not going to school or to his job regularly.  The Vyvanse dose was subsequently increased to 140 mg qam, however, it was felt not to be effective and therefore discontinued and the patient was switched to Adderall XR 70 mg qam.  He also continued to take Zoloft 75 mg qam.  In early 2011, the patient was asked to leave his parents\u2019 home due to his use of cannabis.  He apparently lived with his maternal grandparents first and then moved to a group home.  Zoloft was subsequently discontinued and Celexa was started and was titrated to 40 mg daily.  The patient underwent further medication changes and eventually the patient was also augmented with Strattera.  There was also a trial with low dose Risperdal, but this was not effective and therefore discontinued.  The patient reports abusing cannabis approximately one year ago.  He previously saw psychologist but then started seeing at the Choices program in February, 2011.  The patient reports that his anxiety symptoms have not been properly addressed.  He continues to have generalized worries and is always thinking negative thoughts.  He is always fidgety and biting his nails.  He also has anxiety attacks characterized by shortness of breath, feeling sick, nauseous, and increased heart rate.  He also has performance anxiety and anticipatory anxiety.  Both patient and his mother believe that his anxiety symptoms have not been properly addressed and some of the treatments for ADHD may in fact have worsened his anxiety symptoms.  During the last school year in Grade 11, the patient did fail some courses, so he does continue to have problems with focusing and completing school work.  However, the patient continues to have out of control anxiety symptoms.  The patient reports that his mood symptoms are under fair control.  He reports currently his main problem is with anxiety.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:     Please see History of Present Illness for the pharmacotherapy which has been managed by.  The patient was previously in therapy with.  He started at Choices in February, 2011 with.  He last saw approximately one month ago and reports he has a good connection with him.  However, the patient questions whether therapy at Choices has been effective as he continues to abuse cannabis.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   No acute medical problems.    CURRENT MEDICATION:    Adderall XR 70 mg qam.  Strattera 60 mg qam.  Celexa 50 mg daily.  ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY:   Maternal grandmother with depression.  Maternal aunt with depression.  Maternal aunt with anxiety.  Father with depression.  Maternal grandfather with alcoholism.  SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient was living at Edwards House for the past 4-5 months as he was kicked out of his mother\u2019s home earlier this year because of his drug abuse.  The patient was subsequently moved back into his mother\u2019s house this past week, as he has agreed to follow his parents\u2019 rules.  He is also volunteering at the Boys and Girls Club and runs groups for the kids there.  He still smokes cannabis daily, approximately 0.5 grams per day. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   Patient was pleasant and cooperative during the interview.  He had good eye contact and did not exhibit any psychomotor changes.  His gait was grossly normal.  No abnormal body movements, no tics noted.  He was polite with the interviewer and his mother.  No disruptive behaviors noted.  He was alert and oriented.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  His affect was euthymic.  Mood was stable.  Thought form was logical.  Thought content, denied suicidal ideations, denied homicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  IMPRESSION:   17 year old male with history and presentation consistent with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and ADHD.  He also has a history of depression but that is currently stable.  The patient has received high doses of stimulant treatment for ADHD; however these treatments at high doses may be worsening and exacerbating his anxiety symptoms.  Although the patient is on a high dose of an SSRI, it is likely that the high dose stimulants may be counteracting the anxiolytic effect of the SSRI.  Therefore, the first step should be to reduce the dose of his ADHD treatments and to target his anxiety symptoms as a primary target.  Once his anxiety symptoms are adequately treated, his focus and attention span may improve.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  ADHD.  Major Depressive Disorder by  history.  Cannabis abuse. Axis II:   Deferred Axis III:  Non contributory Axis IV:   Had been living in a group home.  Some academic problems.  Primary  Support. Axis V: GAF = 60  Psychiatric Evaluation Re:  Liam Barro August 13, 2011 Page 4  PLAN:   Will decrease Adderall XR to 40 mg qam as the high dose of Adderall may be exacerbating his anxiety symptoms. Will continue Celexa 50 mg daily for now.  The target dosage for an anxiety disorder is Celexa 20-40 mg daily. Will continue Strattera 60 mg qam for combination treatment for ADHD.  Will consider tapering and discontinuing Strattera in the future to obtain the patient\u2019s baseline symptoms. Return to clinic in one week for immediate follow up. I will manage the patient and stabilize him before returning the patient back to his paediatrician.  The patient also stated he would continue to follow up with Pat Doyle at Choices to address substance abuse issues.  I explained to patient that his use of cannabis may be helping with his anxiety symptoms over the short term but overall, his cannabis use is a barrier to reduction to his overall psychiatric symptoms."

The patient is still non compliant at times, but the core symptoms of ADHD are now adequately addressed with Concerta.

He especially has appetite suppression at breakfast and lunchtime.  He catches up at the end of the day as he is hungry when he comes home.  The patient sleeps well and sleeps at approximately 7 pm onwards.  No change in sleep patterns have been noticed since starting Concerta.  The teachers have noticed that the patient becomes somewhat too quiet first thing in the morning however he becomes talkative again around lunchtime.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   The patient was diagnosed with ADHD by Dr. Lindsay Bates and was started on Concerta about one month ago and has had good response.  The patient continues to receive OT to address fine motor skills.

IMPRESSION:   5 year old male with a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of ADHD, combined type.  The patient has responded well to the initiation of Concerta but has some increase in ADHD symptoms during the late afternoon hours, presumably due to Concerta wearing off.

Axis II:   Deferred Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   School Axis V: GAF = 70  PLAN:   Will continue Concerta 36 mg qam for ADHD.   Will start Ritalin 5 mg q 3 pm for late afternoon coverage for ADHD symptoms. I counselled the parents regarding the patient\u2019s intake of food during the day.  I advised them to have the patient eat a big breakfast before they administer the Concerta and also to have calorie laden drinks and energy bar at noon time to ensure the patient gets adequate caloric intake.

The patient works as a dentist and is very high functioning.   He has anxiety related to procedures that he does at work.  This is chronic but it seems to be more difficult to control recently, as he is starting to miss some days at work and it is also affecting his functioning at home.  He has anticipatory anxiety and heightened response to when people move when he is doing dental procedures on them.  For example, he would become highly anxiety if his patient would move or feel pain when injecting patient with needle, or when performing a procedure.  He said he spends all of his time at work worrying about if the patient that he is working on will move or have pain.  The patient reports that he becomes highly exhausted when he gets home and occasionally he will miss days from work due to being exhausted.  He states he may call in sick once every 6-8 weeks.  He runs a busy dental practice in which he runs two dental chairs and an overflow chair and has two dental hygienists.  He works three 11 hour days per week and he states he is busy all day.  However, he is uncomfortable all day as he is waiting for the patient to jump or be in pain.  He states during procedures he has anxiety attacks characterized by his heart racing, extreme nervousness and diaphoresis.  He also states the when patient jumps from a procedure or a needle; he states the patient gets angry.  However, he expends much energy trying to control his emotions and anxiety when the patient does finally jump.  However, when he comes home he is exhausted and is wife is beginning to notice that he is becoming more moody.  For example, he now has no patience and little things will set him off at work and at home.  He states he is irritable and on edge.  He also reports difficulty sleeping and has multiple early morning awakenings.  However, his sleep comes and goes and this seems to wax and wane with the stress level he is experiencing.  However, he reports adequate concentration and adequate appetite.  He denies any thoughts of self harm.  He denies any feelings of hopelessness.  He denies any generalized anxiety, in fact his worries are mainly regarding the procedures and if he inflicts pain on them.  The patient states that when he goes to work initially it is hard to get started, but once he gets started he is able to continue on with his work.  What makes things more difficult is that he has 3 days on and 4 days off, so after coming back from 4 days off he has difficulty coming back to work.  Again he states that the initial couple of hours of work are the most difficult but once he is able to get over that, he is able to complete his work satisfactorily.  He denies any social phobia.  He denies any obsessions or compulsions.  He denies any avoidant behaviors.

The patient\u2019s practice is at Mic Mac Mall and he works 11 hour days, 3 days on, 4 days off.   He has been practicing for the past 20 years.  He states these procedures have been anxiety provoking but he has been able to cope with it until recently.  As stated in the HPI he has performance anxiety and his greatest fear is if his patients are going to move, especially with drilling or the use of needles.  He knows that these are irrational fears.  Despite the fact that the patient does not have any social phobia, he does have problems speaking in public.  He states this has implications for his work as he is often times asked to give lectures and seminars regarding his work.  He has recently wanted to sub-specialize in sleep medicine dentistry, but he has not been able to get over his fear of speaking in public, and only when he starts to speak in public will he begin to market a niche practice that relies heavily on public speaking and marketing.  He also reports fears of flying at times. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   The patient is a pleasant and cooperative adult male.  His speech exhibited normal patterns.  His affect was anxious. Mood stable.  Thought form was logical.  Thought content, patient denied suicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  He had anticipatory anxiety and reported a history of performance anxiety.  He also has a fear of public speaking.  IMPRESSION:   48 year old male who has a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of Anxiety Disorder.  The patient has participatory anxiety and performance anxiety related to the dental procedures that he performs.  The patient notes that he is beginning to lose control over these anxiety symptoms and is causing him to miss days at work and is now manifesting itself at home in the form of irritability and feeling on edge.  He also has sleep problems due to anxiety.  At the current time, the patient has mild symptoms and he is high functioning.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Anxiety Disorder nos.  Consider specific phobia related to dental  procedures.   Axis II:   None known Axis III:  Non-contributory  Axis IV:   Work Axis V: GAF = 65     PLAN:   No psychotropic medications indicated at this time as patient only has mild anxiety symptoms related to dental procedures. Will refer patient for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a private psychologist, Dr. Marc Blumberg. Patient can return to clinic on an as need basis.  If his anxiety symptoms worsen, then I advised him to make an appointment with me in the future to consider treatment with an SSRI or with a beta blocker such as Propranolol.  If his anxiety symptoms are more sustained, then I would consider starting patient on an SSRI.  However, if anxiety symptoms are more related to specific situations, then would consider the beta blocker one hour before the anxiety provoking event to reduce the physiological flight or fight response."

  "content": "Psychiatric Evaluation  DOB : 22/09/1994 Date of evaluation: April 27, 2011  The patient was seen with his parents for a psychiatric evaluation.  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:   The patient is a 6 year old male who lives with his parents and two older sisters.  He is currently in Grade 1  REASON FOR REFERRAL:    ADHD and oppositional behaviors.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by.  Recently the patient has exhibited increased aggression and is having trouble in social situations, missing time in school due to visits to the principal due to disruptive behaviors.  The patient was diagnosed last year with ADHD by Dr. Sarah Shea.  Patient was started on Biphentin and was on Biphentin 20 mg daily for approximately one year.  However, recently the patient has been exhibiting increasing aggression.  Patient would kick, punch and bite people such as his teachers, other peers, and his parents.  He also has been exhibiting frequent meltdowns and aggressive outbursts.  His aggression outbursts seem to be set off by the littlest things and his reaction is out of proportion to the consequence.  Patient has been increasingly oppositional and defiant both at school and at home.  Dr. Frent increased the Biphentin to 30 mg qam a couple of weeks ago.  However, the patient exhibited worsening aggressive behaviors and therefore it was discontinued.  However, even when Biphentin was discontinued for a one week period, patient continued to have aggressive outbursts.  Patient was subsequently started on Adderall XR 5 mg qam and this seemed to help somewhat but he did continue to have outbursts.  It was increased to 5 mg qam and 5 mg q noon one week ago.  Mother states this does help with his ADHD symptoms but he does continue to have aggressive outbursts.  Parents are at their wits\u2019 end as they have tried multiple techniques to try and contain the behaviors.  No matter what they tried over the past couple of weeks, patient continues to have outbursts and has increasingly oppositional defiant behaviors.   The patient apparently has a very short fuse and would be set off by the littlest of provocation.  When he doesn\u2019t get his own way, he has a meltdown. Apparently, those family members in the household and his teachers and peers in school are somewhat nervous around him as they are afraid of setting him off.  Because of his aggressive behaviors and disruptive behaviors, patient does not have many friends and doesn\u2019t get invited to sleepovers or parties, presumably from his behaviors.  Although he has excellent academic performance, he has significant social skills deficits.  The patient has longstanding hyperactivity, distractibility, and impulsivity.  The parents state they can deal with the ADHD symptoms but are at a loss for how to contain the aggressive behaviors as it appears that nothing works.  He apparently does not resort to property destruction.  No history of animal cruelty.  No history of fire setting.  Patient does not have any apparent fears.  No history of compulsions or obsessions.  He does not have a history of motor or vocal tics.   PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:     Patient was diagnosed with ADHD in March, 2010 by.  Patient was on Biphentin 20 mg for approximately one year.  This was increased to 30 mg but patient had worsening aggression so this was discontinued.  Patient was recently started on Adderall  XR and his ADHD symptoms have responded but he continues to have aggressive behaviors.  Concerta was tried in the past, but he couldn\u2019t swallow the pills.  Patient is only able to sprinkle his medications on food.  Family has recently enlisted the help of Tracy Taggert, a private psychologist in the community to help with the behavioral plan at home and at school.   PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Patient has a history of Asthma.  He had a closed head injury when he was 2 years old from a fall.  Mother wonders if this closed head injury has any impact on his current symptomatology.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Adderall XR 5 mg qam and 5 mg q noon.  FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother has a history of postpartum depression.  Father has a history of possible ADD which has been undiagnosed and untreated.  There is a paternal aunt with depression.

There is also a maternal half-aunt with depression.  The patient\u2019s 15 year old sister has OCD and is treated by Dr. Alexa Bagnell.  Patient\u2019s 11 year old sister with learning disability. SOCIAL HISTORY:   Patient does not have any history of developmental delays.  They did notice early on that patient was somewhat hyperactive.  When he started school, he had difficulty in the classroom environment so he was sent to the developmental centre and was diagnosed with ADHD.  At the time of diagnosis at the developmental centre he was also found to have oppositional behaviors, but did not meet the criteria for oppositional defiant disorder at the time.  The patient does not have any friends and he does not get invited to any social events or parties with classmates.  He is apparently a bright student and he does well academically.  He is also athletic.  His parents are quite supportive of patient.  MENTAL STATUS EXAM:     The patient was disruptive throughout the entire interview.  He refused to comply with questions asked of him.  Throughout the significant portion of the interview he would have meltdowns and would scream at the top of his lungs when asked to do something or when limits were set by his parents.  He also had difficulty sitting still and had no regard for other\u2019s property as he would step on my briefcases and would take things from desk without asking.  He did not exhibit any facial or motor tics.  His gait was grossly normal.  His speech exhibited normal patterns.  Receptive and expressive language appears grossly intact.  His mood was quite labile and irritable.  His intellectual functioning appears above average for his age.  PHYSICAL EXAM:   Blood pressure 110/70.  No abnormal body movements noted.  Cardiovascular was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  The neurological examination was deferred as patient was non-compliant.   IMPRESSIONS:   the patient is a 6 year old male who has a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of ADHD with co morbid oppositional defiant disorder.  The patient has exhibited worsening aggressive behaviors which has been made worse with higher dosages of Biphentin.  Even with a trial off of stimulants, patient continued to have aggressive behaviors.  Currently, Adderall XR appears to be helping his ADHD symptoms but he continues to have aggressive behaviors.  Patient appears to have a very short fuse and has meltdowns with the littlest of provocation.  The patient is currently aggressive with classmates, teachers and his parents and the adults are having a hard time containing him despite highly structures settings both at home and at school.  Psychiatric Evaluation Re:  Brendon Burke April 27, 2011 Page 4  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:     Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined type.  Oppositional Defiant Disorder Axis II:  Deferred  Axis III:  History of closed head injury.  Asthma.   Axis IV:   Problems at school.  Problems at home Axis V: GAF   50  PLAN:   Will start Risperdal solution 0.25 mg qhs for 3 days then increase to 0.5 mg qhs thereafter for extreme aggressive behaviours and impulsive aggression. Will consolidate the dosage of Adderall XR to 10 mg qam for ADHD symptoms.  Once his impulsive aggression is controlled then we will consider titrating the dose of Adderall XR in the future to optimize his ADHD treatment. The patient and his family will continue individual and family therapy with their private psychologist. Return to clinic in one week for follow up."

  "content": "Psychiatric Clinic Note  DOB : 22/09/1994 Date of evaluation: July 4, 2011  The patient was seen with his father for a follow up visit.   CURRENT MEDICATION:    Adderall, XR 10 mg qam, Risperdal M-tabs 0.5 mg bid.  The patient is a 6 year old male with a history of ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  The patient has responded well to the increase of Risperdal from bid to tid dosing.  Although he is not aggression free, he is better than he was and has been happier in general and less volatile.  The patient denies any side effects from the medication.  His biggest of contention is at home fighting with his sister.  His sisters are age 11 and 15.  The parents are working with the patient\u2019s sisters to help them understand that the patient needs special handling.  The parents are currently meeting with the private psychologist to devise a behavioral plan to contain patient\u2019s behavior.  Today we went over the behavioral plan and did psycho education with the patient\u2019s father as the father continues to believe erroneously that rewarding the patient is like bribing the patient.  The patient has not had any problems swallowing the M-Tabs as it dissolves in his mouth and he doesn\u2019t need to swallow.  MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   The patient continues to exhibit disruptive behaviors in the office.  He continues to be oppositional and defiant.  He is difficult to redirect by his father.  However, no mood lability noted.  PHYSICAL EXAM:   The patient did not exhibit any cogwheel rigidity in his upper extremities.  No nystagmus noted.  No abnormal oral buccal movements noted.  No tongue fasciculations noted.  IMPRESSION:  The patient has responded well to the increase of Risperdal.  However, he continues to have oppositional and defiant behaviors which are not a target for medication treatment but rather the behavioral plan.  PLAN:  Will continue current medications at current dosages at this time. The referral to the Children\u2019s Day Treatment Program is pending. The patient and his parents will follow up with the private psychologist for the behavioral plan. Return to clinic in 2-3 months for follow up."

CURRENT MEDICATION:    Adderall, XR 10 mg qam, Risperdal Solution 0.5 mg bid.  Patient is a 6 year old male with a history of ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  The patient has been exhibiting worsening behaviors since the last visit.  The patient has been kicked out of the after school program secondary to aggressive behaviors and anger outbursts.  Over the past week the patient has been acting out more physically in which he would kick, punch and choke other kids at recess.  He has even thrown a chair in the after school program.   The parents report that the aggressive outbursts seem to occur mainly in the late afternoon.  The teachers report that his attention span is adequate, however the main problem right now is the aggressive outbursts and physical aggression towards others.  For the most part patient is tolerating the medications without side effects.  Today we went over the treatment plan.  If the patient continues to exhibit aggressive behaviors, then the patient will need to be referred to a more intense service such as the Children\u2019s Day Program through the.  With the patient\u2019s current level of aggression, he is not able to maintain his behaviors to be included in group activities with other kids.    MENTAL STATUS EXAM:    The patient was pleasant cooperative during the interview.  He did not exhibit any disruptive behaviors in the interview.  Affect was euthymic, mood stable.   Patient was weighed today, and he weighed 51 lbs.  IMPRESSIONS:   ADHD with co-morbid Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  Patient has exhibited worsening behaviors since the last visit.  He has been kicked out of the after school program due to aggression.  He has gained approximately 4 lbs since being in Risperdal.   PLAN:    Will increase Risperdal to 0.5 mg po tid for impulsive aggression.   The mid day dosing of Risperdal should help to address the late afternoon aggressive outbursts.  Will also switch to Risperdal solution to Risperdal M tabs so that the patient can take a pill form of Risperdal and will dissolve in the mouth without having to swallow a pill. Will continue Adderall XR 10 mg qam for ADHD symptoms. Laboratories are still pending at this time. Will make a referral to the Children\u2019s Day Treatment Program as patient is exhibiting significant aggressive behaviours.  The patient and family will continue with their private therapist.

CURRENT MEDICATION:    Adderall, XR 10 mg qam, Risperdal Solution 0.5 mg qam and qhs  Patient is a 6 year old male with a history of ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  The patient had significant improvement of his impulsive aggression with the increase of Risperdal.  Patient has virtually no anger outbursts both at home and at school, although he does have periods where he becomes irritable.  Parents report that the extreme outbursts are now gone and life at home is much better.  Teachers at school report that patient has problems with low moods.  He currently has difficulty verbalizing his moods while at school.  The parents are happy as the teachers are helping patient verbalize his feelings rather than acting out.   One problem is that patient was recently kicked out of the Excel Program, which is an after school program for kids when school is finished.  This program is funded by the School Board.  However, mother says that the program is not accommodating patient\u2019s mental illness and they decided to kick him out of the program.  I explained to mother that if this is a federally funded program that they are by law required to accommodate patient\u2019s mental illness, otherwise this is discrimination and they would not be allowed to use federal funding for such discrimination.  Today, I counseled mother and father regarding techniques on how to contain patient\u2019s behaviors.  I recommended that they both read \u201cThe Explosive Child\u201d, which helps parents deal with disruptive behaviors in kids who are prone to aggressive outbursts. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:     Weight was 47 lbs.  Height 46 inches.  Patient did not exhibit any cogwheel rigidity of upper extremities.  Gait was grossly normal.  Extraocular movements intact.\u00a0 No nystagmus noted on lateral gaze.  No abnormal orobuccal movements noted.  IMPRESSIONS:   ADHD with co-morbid Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  Patient has responded well to the increase of Risperdal as he no longer has impulsive outbursts.  His ADHD symptoms are under good control as he is able to focus in class and has not exhibited any hyperactivity or impulsivity.  No side effects noted from the medications.   PLAN:    Will continue current medications at current dosages at this time. Will obtain CBC, electrolytes, BUN creatinine, free T4, TSH, LFT\u2019s, and prolactin level. Patient and family will continue with their private therapist.   Return to clinic in 3 months for follow up.   I will write a letter to the Excel Program advocating that they accommodate patient\u2019s mental illness in their program."

The patient continues to exhibit depressive symptoms.  He has not been able to attend school as he continues to have poor focus and low motivation.  He continues to isolate himself socially and does not get any exercise and barely leaves the house.  He plays video games.  He denies any thoughts of self harm.  On a positive note, the patient was accepted to the Adolescent Day Treatment Program, but the wait list is approximately 8-9 months.  In the meantime I stated to patient and his mother that I would see the patient for individual and family therapy as apparently the family is not able to find medical coverage for a private therapist and the family is unable to afford money out of pocket.  Today I went over techniques to help the patient cope with stressors and also spoke with his mother regarding the behavioural plan to increase the structure for the patient as he is currently isolative and not going outside.  The patient did agree to increase his activity level and would make a schedule for a list of activities that he would do every day.  IMPRESSION:    ADHD with co morbid Major Depressive Disorder most likely.  The patient continues to exhibit depressive symptoms and has not been able to attend school.  PLAN:    Will start Wellbutrin XL 150 mg qam for one week and then increase to 300 mg qam thereafter for ADHD symptoms and depressive symptoms.   The patient previously had worsening irritability with stimulant treatment, therefore stimulants may not be the best choice for this patient as he continues to have significant mood symptoms.

The patient has been diagnosed with ADHD and has a history of school failure.  He has always done poorly at school and basically has had poor grades since Grade 7.  Multiple ADHD meds have been tried.  The patient had a trial of Concerta in August, 2010 \u2013 September, 2010 with no change in his symptoms.  The patient was subsequently switched to Adderal SR which increased his irritability and anger.  The patient was then switched to Stratera which caused abdominal pains and diarrhea and was therefore discontinued.  His current problems are that he is not able to focus; he becomes easily frustrated and has been missing a lot of time at school.  He isolates himself and spends a lot of time indoors.   Recently, the patient has been feeling angry and has been frustrated over small things and wants to be left alone.  He states he has frequent anger outbursts and has broken things, but has not resorted to aggression towards others.  He does yell a lot.  The patient reports when he gets angry he does not feel anything and he feels out of control.  The patient reports his mood lability has been worsening over the last two years.  He denies low moods and denies any drugs of abuse.  However, he does report at times he feels hopeless and he has problems with sleep.

He first had suicidal ideations at the age of 12 but denies any suicidal attempts.  He does have a history of cutting.  The last time he cut himself was two years ago.  He last had suicidal ideations one year ago.  The patient has yet to receive psycho educational testing despite his long history of doing poorly.  The parents said they have tried approaching the school about getting him psycho educational testing but there is a wait list.  Dr. Morley initially raised the concern about a learning disability, however the patient will be ending high school soon and he still has not done well since Junior High.  The parents feel the school is just moving him along and he is not really learning anything.  The patient reports that he has perceptual disturbances at times.  He states he sees things, as he sees a hooded man.  He first started having these perceptual disturbances as a child.   He also states he hears whispers although he has not heard voices for quite some time now.  He denies any frank delusions.  No history of grandiosity.  No highly reckless behaviors.  The patient reports a history of palpitations.  These only occur when he is angry and does not occur randomly.  He denies these palpitations wake him from sleep.

He has been treated with multiple psychotropics for ADHD including Concerta, Adderal XR and Stratera as noted in the HPI.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:     The patient has a history of palpitations associated with exercise.  He was referred to Cardiology and the ECG was normal.  Cardiology did not opine that this was a malignant arrhythmia and they did not need to follow up with patient.  FAMILY HISTORY:    Mother is on Effexor for depression.  Maternal great aunt with history of depression.  The biological father\u2019s family psychiatric history is unknown but mother states biological father has anger problems.    SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with his mother, step-father, and 11 year old sister.  Biological father and mother separated when patient was born, apparently secondary to the biological father being abusive.  The patient has no current contact with his biological father.  The patient does not currently have an intimate relationship although he states he would like a girlfriend.  He states that he recently broke up with his girlfriend over trust issues.  He becomes very jealous over his girlfriend\u2019s contact with other males.  He has a history of multiple suspensions from school for fighting and arguing with a teacher.  He says he has difficulty following rules.  He denies any drug use although he states he has experimented with cannabis in the past.  RATING SCALES:    The patient had the Connors\u2019 filled out by the parent on February 9, 2010 by Dr. Morley.  The patient was in a clinically significant range with regard to the ADHD index and the inattentive subtype. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:     The patient was pleasant and cooperative during the interview.   He is an adolescent male.  He had good hygiene and eye contact.  He had slight psychomotor retardation.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  His affect was blunted and withdrawn.  Mood stable.  Thought form was logical thought content.  The patient denied any suicidal ideations, denied homicidal ideations.   No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  He did not appear to be responding to internal stimuli.  No loosening of associations noted.   IMPRESSION:     17 year old male who has a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of Depressive Disorder NOS.  The differential diagnosis includes Major Depressive Disorder and Adjustment Disorder.  The patient also needs to be assessed for a learning disability.  The patient has ADHD by history.  There is a family history of depression, however the patient currently denies any low moods.  He does exhibit significant irritability which may be part of a depressive syndrome.  Will need to gather more collateral and longitudinal information to aid with diagnosis and treatment planning.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Depressive Disorder, NOS. Rule out Adjustment Disorder.  Rule out Major Depressive Disorder. Rule out learning disability. ADHD by history Axis II:   Deferred Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   School failure Axis V: GAF = 50  PLAN:   I advised the parents to refer the patient for psychological testing as soon as possible as patient needs psycho educational testing to rule out a learning disability.   The school option to obtain psychological testing may not occur in a timely manner.  May need to refer the patient for private testing with a private psychologist. The patient would do well to attend individual therapy sessions with a psychologist.  At this time, the public mental health program has a wait list of over 18 months.  At the next visit, I will discuss with the family options for a private therapist although this would place a financial burden on the family.  The step-father will look into his employee benefits with the military to see if the patient qualifies for follow up with military mental health program.  Currently the step-father and mother are not married and not common law, but he will discuss with the employer to see if they can slot in the patient for immediate counselling.  The patient may also receive psycho educational testing in that venue. No psychotropics indicated at this time until the diagnosis is clarified.  Will need to gather more collateral and longitudinal information to aid with diagnosis and treatment planning. Return to clinic in two weeks for follow up."

The parents opined that this may have contributed to her stressors last year which triggered her anxiety.   Overall, the patient does well academically.  She is a good writer and great at spelling.  She does need some help at Math and Science; however she goes to school every day and this mainly due to the prompting by her mother who is adamant she attends every single day.

There has been slight improvement in therapy as patient is able to control the times when she pulls her hair.  For example, she has been able to abstain from pulling her hair over the past week.  However, she continues to have significant anticipatory and generalized anxiety symptoms.  Good prognostic factors are that her parents are very supportive and patient is in an accommodating school as the teachers appear to understand what she needs.

IMPRESSION:   Generalized Anxiety Disorder.  Rule out ADHD.  The patient has responded to the initiation of Citalopram without side effects.  However, he continues to have significant anxiety symptoms which have been exacerbated by a recent break up and also a caffeine addiction.  PLAN:     Will continue Citalopram, 20 mg daily for anxiety symptoms. I advised patient to start to decrease his intake of caffeine as it may be exacerbating his anxiety symptoms. If the patient continues to have problems with attention, distractibility and being fidgety, then consider augmenting the patient\u2019s treatment with a stimulant such as Concerta or Vyvanse.  However, before an ADHD treatment is initiated, will need to stabilize his anxiety symptoms. Return to clinic in one month for follow up."

Mother states that she has multiple anger outbursts at home and that this occurs almost daily.  She has a low frustration tolerance and mother states she works herself up.  Mother states that patient recently becomes stuck on certain topics and becomes inpatient and angry.  Mother states that she has been using Magic 1-2-3 for containment of the out of control behaviors but this is not working as effectively as it did in the past.  The patient also hits herself when she becomes upset but she denies any suicidal ideations.  No history of suicide attempts.  The patient does worry about multiple things and is anxious about finishing her school work.  Mother states patient has to have everything perfect.  However, there is no evidence of sustained generalized worries.  No history of social phobia.  No obsessions and no rituals.  No history of separation anxiety.

Father was also on an antidepressant with the conflict with his ex-wife.  The maternal mental health history is unknown.  SOCIAL HISTORY:    As mentioned in the HPI, father has sole custody as patient was physically abused by mother\u2019s boyfriend while in mother\u2019s care.  Patient\u2019s parents were together until patient was 2.  The patient was subsequently sent to live with her mother from ages 2-7 and this is when patient was abused by mother\u2019s boyfriend.

  "content": "Psychiatric Evaluation  DOB : 22/02/2001 Date of evaluation: June 22, 2011  The patient was seen with his mother for a psychiatric evaluation.  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:    The patient is a 10 year old male who lives with his parents in .  He is currently in Grade 4 and will be attending Grade 5 next school year.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:    Assessment for Anxiety Disorder and recommendations for treatment.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:     The patient was referred for a psychiatric consultation by .  The patient was diagnosed with ADHD and Dyslexia two years ago by , a psychologist.  The patient was subsequently started on Concerta which was titrated to 27 mg qam.  The patient was on this medication for 1 \u00bd years with good results.  The patient had improved attention while on Concerta.  However, Concerta caused significant side effects including appetite suppression and initial insomnia.  There were concerns that patient was not gaining adequate weight as he already has a small stature to begin with, therefore the medications were stopped at the end of the school year.  Last summer the patient had a drug holiday and he did gain weight.  However, the patient was started on Citalopram in the Fall of 2010 as the patient\u2018s father had concerns that the patient had anxiety.  The patient\u2019s father had been taking Citalopram for anxiety and depression himself.  He therefore gave 5 mg to his son last fall and this had significant effects on his symptoms.  The patient has been taken Citalopram 5 mg daily since last Fall with no side effects.  The patient has a history of significant anxiety symptoms.  In Grade Primary, the patient had separation anxiety and he continued to have separation anxiety when he was older as he would worry something bad would happy to his parents when he was away from them.  However, with Citalopram, the patient has less separation anxiety.  The patient has a history of generalized worrying.  He would worry frequently, especially about what people thought about him.  He has a history of being teased about being the smallest person in his class.  However, he would worry that others were scrutinizing him because of his short stature.  He also previously had thoughts that something bad would happen to him and he would frequently worry about this.  Again, Citalopram treatment has helped to reduce these generalized worries.  The patient also previously had anxiety attacks characterized by shortness of breath and extreme nervousness.  These anxiety attacks have also subsided with Citalopram treatments.  The patient also previously had mood symptoms in which he was irritable and easily frustrated.  He also had thoughts of self harm as he felt life was so hard.  Ever since Citalopram treatment, these mood symptoms have not reappeared and he denies any thoughts of self hard since last Fall.  The patient denies any performance anxiety.  He denies any obsessions and denies any compulsions.  The patient did have a history of initial insomnia and frequent nightmares, but his sleep has improved with Citalopram treatment.  Six weeks ago the patient switched from French Immersion to English classes and he apparently is thriving now and is now reading at grade level in English when before he was struggling in French.  Overall the patient is doing well.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   This is patient\u2019s first psychiatric evaluation.  He has been diagnosed with ADHD and Dyslexia and had been on Concerta treatment.   He is currently on Citalopram for treatment of anxiety disorder.  He has never had counseling.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:     No ongoing medical problems.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Citalopram, 5 mg daily.  FAMILY HISTORY:   Father has a history of depression, anxiety and ADD.  Paternal grandfather with depression.  Paternal uncle with ADD and depression.  Mother with history of depression and is currently on Zoloft.  SOCIAL HISTORY:    The patient lives with his parents in .  He has a half sister who is currently attending .  Mother began noticing problems when he was 2 years old, when the patient had difficulty going into crowded places.  There was also marked separation anxiety when patient started Grade Primary.  Patient\u2019s father is a family doctor and mother manages father\u2019s private practice. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   The patient was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview.  He does have a small stature.  No abnormal body movements noted.  No hyperkinetic behaviors noted.  No disruptive behaviors noted.  Speech exhibited normal pattern.  His affect was slightly anxious.  Mood stable.  Thought form was logical thought content.   The patient denied suicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.   IMPRESSION:   10 year old male with a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of Anxiety Disorder.  The patient meets criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and has Separation Anxiety Disorder by history.  The patient has had good response to low dose Citalopram.  The patient also has co morbid ADD by history.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Generalized Anxiety most likely.  Separation Anxiety Disorder by history. ADD by history. Axis II:   Non contributory Axis III:  Non contributory Axis IV:   No current psychosocial problems. Axis V: GAF  = 70  PLAN:   Citalopram treatment is safe in this age group for the treatment of anxiety disorders.  It appears that the patient has had good response to low dose of Citalopram.  As it appears that patient has been adequately treated since last year, would consider tapering and eventually discontinuing Citalopram over a two week period to assess for baseline anxiety symptoms.  If the anxiety symptoms return, then consider restarting Citalopram at that time.  Generally one would continue with SSRI treatment for anxiety for 6-9 months of the patient doing well, and then would taper and eventually discontinue the SSRI. At this time I would not recommend that patient be referred for individual therapy as patient is currently doing well.  Also, patient is very young and may not benefit from the cognitive aspects of talk therapy.   However, in the future, if patient\u2019s anxiety symptoms worsen, then consider referring patient to a therapist, especially as he gets older and becomes a teenager.  Puberty and the transition between elementary and junior high school may be times that the patient may be triggered to have more anxiety symptoms. The patient will follow up with  for continued evaluation and treatment of ADD. I do not plan on seeing the patient again as the patient is doing well.  However, if patient has worsening anxiety symptoms in the future, then please do not hesitate to contact me or re-refer patient to me."

  "content": "Psychiatric Clinic Note  DOB : 02/05/2004 Date of evaluation: August 10, 2011  The patient was seen with his parents for a follow up visit to psychiatry clinic.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Strattera 80 mg qhs.    The patient is a 7 year old male with history of Autistic Spectrum Disorder and ADHD.  The parents have not noticed any difference in his ability to focus with the higher dosage of Strattera.  The patient has significant mood lability.  He is also very rigid and inflexible and gets stuck on things.  He has difficulty with transitions and when he gets very frustrated at times, he would hit people.  The parents are very concerned about the patient\u2019s mood lability.  We spent much of the session talking about ways to contain the patient\u2019s behaviors.  However, it became apparent during the interview that it would be difficult to address his aggressive behaviors solely with behavioral management.  Today we went over the benefits and risks with starting a mood stabilizer such as Risperdal to address the mood lability and impulsive aggression.  After much discussion, the parents were comfortable with starting this medication.  IMPRESSION:  Autistic Spectrum Disorder and ADHD.  The patient has significant mood lability and impulsive aggression.  The increase in Strattera has not helped improve his concentration and focus.  PLAN:   Will start Risperdal, 0.5 mg qhs for three days and then increase to 0.5 mg bid thereafter for mood lability and impulsive aggression. Will continue Strattera 80 mg qhs for ADHD.  Will reassess his attention span when school starts.  May need to reconsider switching back to a stimulant, especially if the Risperdal proves effective for his mood lability. Will obtain baseline laboratories, CBC, Electrolytes, BUN Creatanine, liver function tests, TSH, Free T4 Count, Prolactin level, Fasting Lipid level and fasting glucose. Return to clinic in 2-3 weeks for follow up."

The patient reports some day time sedation with the initiation of Risperdal.  However, mother reports the patient has responded well as he is less moody, and is less labile.  He also appears to be more compliant.  Mother also noticed the patient is not as active and is calmer.  Today I gathered more history from the mother regarding the patient\u2019s response to Strattera.  When the patient was taken off of Strattera, he became more irritable and agitated.  When he is on Strattera, he appears more focused and less irritable.  Mother states that the combination of Strattera and Risperdal appears to be stabilizing his mood and aggression.  He is also able to focus and concentrate on the higher dosage of Strattera.  Today I went over some methods to help the mother contain the patient\u2019s behavior/  IMPRESSION:  Autistic Spectrum Disorder and ADHD.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:   Assessment of disruptive behaviors in the context of Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:     The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .   The patient has been diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  The patient was diagnosed at age 4 by .  He was subsequently followed by , developmental pediatrician at the IWK.  He was initially started on Biphentin at 5 years of age, however patient developed rebound at the end of the day.  He was only on Biphentin for one month.    They did note some improvement of his ADHD symptoms at school but he continued to be emotional and had rebound at the end of the day.  The patient was then switched to Strattera in which the parents did notice some improvement but he continued to exhibit disruptive behaviors.  He also had a trial of Vyvanse but developed abdominal pain and mood problems.  Concerta was recently started in June for approximately 2 weeks but he developed rebound at the end of the day.  Strattera was initially weaned and discontinued as there was a question about its effect.  They started to taper Strattera in May, 2011, and discontinued it on June 2, 2011.  The parents have noticed that his behaviors have become more erratic and he has more aggression and oppositional behaviors.  He also continues to interrupt frequently and is uncooperative.  They also noticed he was more restless and hyperactive and non-compliant.  Because of these worsening behaviors the patient was placed again on Strattera and he is currently taking 70 mg daily.  At the current dose of Strattera he continues to have significant ADHD symptoms, especially during the early hours at school.  Father describes that between 9-10 am is the most difficult for patient at school.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:     The patient was seen by last July and confirmed the diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder.  There was not ongoing management from psychiatry.  Also the parents report there is no ongoing management with developmental pediatrics.   Currently, is following the patient\u2019s medications and the patient and family are seeing .   has seen the patient starting in January, 2011, and the patient was recently placed in Social Skills group from March-May.  In this group, the patient has showed a number of strengths and has acquired socialization skills to work with his peers.  They have noted that in groups he exhibits significant hyperactivity and has difficulty sitting in the circle during group activities.   The patient has exhibited some obsessive behaviors including smacking his rear end inappropriately and aggressive talk.  No tics noted to date.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Strattera 70 mg qhs.    SOCIAL HISTORY:    Patient recently completed Grade 1 and is going into Grade 2.  He has a one to one at school for behavior.  However, he does not currently have academic accommodations.  The full social history was not obtained today as the patient and his family was late for their appointment today. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:     The patient is a 7 year old male.  He was hyperactive and had difficulty sitting still in his chair.  He constantly interrupted interview and was difficult to redirect at times.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  Affect was irritable at times.  Thought form was linear.  Thought content was difficult to assess as patient was non-compliant with interview and had difficulty answering questions.  IMPRESSION:   7 year old male who has a history and presentation consistent with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and ADHD symptoms.  He continues to have hyperactivity, impulsivity and oppositional behaviors.  He has been on multiple ADHD medications and has developed rebound when the stimulants wear off.  To date, Strattera has been the best at controlling his ADHD symptoms, but he continues to have significant disruptive behaviors.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:     Austistic Spectrum Disorder by history.  ADHD.  Rule out emerging Anxiety Disorder Axis II:   None known Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   School.  Peers Axis V: GAF = 60  PLAN:   Will increase Strattera to 80 mg qhs for ADHD symptoms. If the patient continues to have significant disruptive behaviours, then consider augmenting Strattera with low dose immediate release Methylphenidate, 5 mg qam and eventually titrating to qam and qnoon dosing.  Monotherapy with long-acting stimulants appears to be associated with rebound at the end of the day when stimulants wear off.  Hopefully, use of immediate-release, low dose Methylphenidate will alleviate this rebound effect. Return to clinic in one month for immediate follow up."

During the last visit he weighed approximately 86.5 lbs.  The parents have been working hard on addressing the patient\u2019s intake of food and only eating healthy foods.  However, they are concerned about the irritability.  Today I went over some strategies to help the parents contain the behaviors and the irritability.  IMPRESSION:  The patient continues to have mood lability and outbursts.  He also continues to have ADHD symptoms.  It appears that Strattera may be worsening his irritability and also appears to be not effective for ADHD symptoms.  PLAN:   Will taper Strattera to 54 mg qam for one week, then decrease to 36 mg qam for one week, then decrease to 18 mg for one week, then discontinue thereafter. If the patient continues to have problems with ADHD symptoms, then consider starting a stimulant at that time, such as Biphentin.  The patient has been on long acting stimulants in the past, but it appears that Biphentin may have had the best improvement except the patient had rebound at the end of the day when on Biphentin.  However, Risperdal should cover some of the irritability at the end of the day. Return to clinic in 3 weeks for follow up."

I told patient he would benefit from ADHD treatment and possibly treatment for impulsive aggression.  However, he was resistant to the idea of medication treatment and stated that treatments with ADHD would lead to substance abuse.  The patient was not able to contain his anger and left the office abruptly, slamming the doors in the office.  He did not return to the interview.  The interview was therefore finished with his mother.  I explained to the mother that patient would most likely benefit from a non-methylphenidate ADHD medication such as Adderall XR or Vyvanse.  The patient may also benefit from Risperdal to assist with impulsive aggression. I explained to mother that patient is welcome to come back for a follow up visit but that this is voluntary.  If patient continues to exhibit highly disruptive behaviours, then I recommended to mother that she call the  Program at the  as he is currently on the wait list for that program.   apparently made the referral to the  Program when she was seeing patient  I went over the behavioural plan with mother as patient is currently out of control.  I advised mother to take away his privileges and to set up a system whereby he earns back his privileges.  Mother states that she is afraid that patient would become more aggressive once his privileges are taken away.  However, I stated to mother that she call police should the patient become aggressive. If the patient decides that he doesn\u2019t want to return for treatment, that it would be helpful if the mother and father came to the next meeting in two weeks to help them with the behavioural plan and to help them contain the patient\u2019s out of control behaviours. If patient decides to return for treatment, then we will consider a referral to a private therapist for individual and family therapy."

The patient reports he has been fatigued and tired for the past several years.  He reports it takes longer for him to complete is reports at work and he is being scrutinized by his managers as he is not being productive.  Patient reports he is unable to focus and he is fatigued during the day.  He reports he has low moods at times, but he reports that these are not sustained for more than a few hours.  He denies ever having low moods for greater than two weeks sustained.  He states he sleeps 4-6 hours per night and wakes up at 4 am every morning.  He has feelings of guilt at times.  He denies any suicidal ideation although he had intermittent passive suicidal ideations months ago when he started having problems at work.  He denies any suicide attempts.  The patient reports he is not able to focus and is easily distractible.  When he was younger he did well in school and never had attention problems.

He does not meet criteria for depression.  He appears to have adjustment issues to stressor at work.  If no medical problems are contributing to his fatigue and poor concentration, then consider adding Chronic Fatigue Syndrome to the differential diagnosis.  However, the patient currently does have medical problems as he has elevated blood pressure today and he is morbidly obese.  In addition, his mask on his C-Pap is not fitting properly.  PLAN:   As the patient does not have a psychiatric disorder, I am not recommending continued psychiatric follow up at this time. The patient will follow up with his family doctor,  to assess his elevated blood pressure. If patient is medically stable and there are no medical causes to his fatigue and poor concentration, then consider presumptive treatment for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  If the patient has a normal EKG and normal blood pressure, then consider starting a stimulant to aid with the fatigue and poor concentration. I do not plan on following patient as the patient does not have a psychiatric illness."

  "content": "Psychiatric Clinic Note  DOB : 10/10/1994 Date of evaluation: May 4, 2011  The patient was seen with her mother for a follow up visit.  The patient is a 16 year old female with a history of parent/child relationship conflict, learning disability and ADD.  Today the focus of the session was on the relationship between patient and her mother.  What was evident from our first meeting was that patient and her mother have poor communication.  During the session today, they illustrated that poor communication in which mother would blame patient and patient would subsequently withdraw until she would react and blow up at mother in an effort to get her off her back.  Mother was quite tearful during the session as she states she is very worried about the patient as she is often quite irritable with her, disrespectful and does not abide by her rules.  Mother is also worried about patient\u2019s academic performance.  Mother did speak with principal recently and the principal is concerned as patient is failing a few classes and is at risk of not being promoted to the next grade level.  I educated mother on patient\u2019s developmental level as patient currently wants to individuate from her family and wants more freedom.  Mother was eventually able to understand that her daughter needs another set of rules now that she is almost an adult.  The patient also acknowledged that she needed to be more respectful with her mother and needed to comply more with her mother\u2019s wishes and she acknowledged it was her household.  There was much tension during the initial part of the session.  I pointed out to both of them that they have communication styles which lend itself to conflict.  For example, during the session mother kept blaming patient for all of the things that are going wrong, and while mother was doing this, patient would withdraw and have non-verbal communication which was disrespectful as she would roll her eyes, slouch in her chair and dismiss her mother.  When mother was crying as she stated she cared deeply for patient and would just roll her eyes and could not understand why her mother was crying.  In fact, it made her angrier.    At the end of the day, if both parties do not change their communication styles, then they are at risk at not having a connection when patient does become an adult and leaves the  household.   Although the patient gives the impression that she does not care, she in fact was quite engaged during the entire session and was attentive to what was said during the session to improve the communication.  IMPRESSIONS:    Parent child relational conflict.  No evidence of depression.  ADHD and learning disability by history.  PLAN:  Will write a letter to the school stating that patient needs accommodation and needs help in the difficult subjects that she is failing. It is recommended that patient starts on a different stimulant medication such as Adderall XR or Vyvanse to address ADHD symptoms. I offered to continue family therapy sessions with patient and her mother should they choose to continue with family therapy to address their communication styles and to improve their connection with each other.  Patient and mother stated that they would talk more and get back to me should they choose to continue with family therapy. As the patient and mother may choose not to return to clinic, then will transfer patient\u2019s care back to ."

At both the school and in his small options home, the patient has intensive monitoring and structure.  He apparently has shown improvement since being in the small options placement and in school.

She continues to have cutting behaviors in which she cuts to feel better due to emotional dysregulation.  She cuts on her arms and legs; the last time she cut was about 8 days ago.

  "content": "Psychiatric Evaluation  DOB : 27/08/1977 Date of evaluation: September 16, 2011  The patient was seen for a psychiatric evaluation.  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:   The patient is a 33 year old female who lives in .  She is employed as  police officer, and is currently on disability for the past two months secondary to anxiety, nausea and vomiting.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:   Review for optimal medication management of anxiety.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .  The patient has been off of work for the past two months secondary to extreme stress.  The patient is an  police officer and she works as a detective in the General Investigation Section.  She has been with the GIS for the past three years.  This apparently is a high stress job as the hours are long and she has no control over her hours.  The patient states that when she starts a case it can last all night and into the next day.  At times, she only gets a few hours of sleep during a typical work week.  The patient reports some stress reactions approximately two years ago.  As she was not getting enough rest, she was getting very frustrated and had much difficulty getting to work.  Her sleep deprivation stems from the fact that she has to work a lot of overtime as a detective and the hours are unpredictable.  Also, it appears that her sleep walk cycle is reversed as she could be up all night and would sleep a few hours during the day.  The patient also reports that she has endured much office politics and this also has affected her morale at work.  The patient also has been recently separated from her ex-husband, as it was an abusive and toxic marriage.  She has since moved from Tantallon to Elmsdale and currently lives on her own.  Over the past several months she has lost 30 pounds due to suppressed appetite and also reports fatigue and decreased concentration.  She reports her moods at times are irritable.  However, she denies any feelings of hopelessness, denies any feelings of guilt, and denies any self harm.  She also denies any excessive worries, denies any social phobia and denies any anxiety attacks.   In addition to the frustrations in her problems with focus and energy, the patient had developed physical symptoms in which she would feel nauseated and vomit.  This eventually led to her asking for an LOA in May, 2011.  She used up her sick leave of 6 weeks and is currently on Long Term Disability.  Since being off of work, for the past several months, patient reports she is less negative and calmer.  What she did noticed when she was working would be that she would get sick when she was getting ready to go to work.  She has been evaluated by Gastroenterology specialists in which they would scope her and also performed abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds and barium swallow.  All of these tests were normal.  To date, she is continuing to see the GI specialists to review her GI complaints.  The patient has had trials of multiple psychotropics for treatment of presumed anxiety disorder.  Cipralex caused her to be cloudy and nauseous so she only took it for one week.  Effexor caused fogginess and dizziness so she stopped taking this as well.  Ellevil was also tried and not effective.  Most recently she had a brief trial of Imovane, 5 mg at night, but she discontinued this as well as it caused excessive sedation and fogginess.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   The patient is currently seeing a counselor whom she originally saw for marriage counseling.  She sees hers to help cope.  She said this counselor has been helpful as the counselor has helped her to restructure her thinking and expectations.  The patient has been treated for presumed anxiety disorder and the multiple psychotropic trials have not been helpful.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   The patient has endured nausea and vomiting and is currently going to a GI Specialist for ruling out organic etiology.    believes that her nausea and vomiting may be closely related to her emotional problems.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Nexium.  ALLERGIES:  Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen.  FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient is not aware of any family members with mental health problems.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is from Cape Breton and most of her family still live there.  The patient was with her ex-husband for approximately 8 years.  It was a highly conflictual and abusive relationship.  Apparently the ex-husband abused alcohol.  They separated in May, 2010.  The patient is currently a detective with the Halifax Regional Police, and has been a detective for the past 3 years.  Previously, she worked Patrol for many years.  Since coming to the GIS section, her hours have been long and it is a high stress job when compared to her patrol job which is predictable and she was able to have structure during her day.  Now her job as a detective has her up all night and her sleep walk cycle is reversed.  She has moved to  in an attempt to get out of the city and relax and be less stressed   Her job as a detective  involves dealing with serious crime.  The patient states that she has not been able to deal with the stressors on the job, and she was afraid she was going to have a break down and therefore asked for a leave of absence.  She denies any drug use. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   The patient is a pleasant and cooperative adult female.  Her speech exhibited normal patterns.  Her affect was slightly dysthymic.  Mood was slightly low.  Thought form was logical.  Thought content,  patient denied any suicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  No overt anxiety symptoms were noted.  She did exhibit some depressive symptoms.  IMPRESSION:   34 year old female with a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder.  She currently does not meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder or Anxiety Disorder.  She is however at risk for developing either depression or anxiety disorder if she continues to be exposed to her stressors and does not get support for her emotional problems.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Adjustment Disorder with depressive symptoms.  Rule out Major  Depressive Disorder.  Rule out Anxiety Disorder. Axis II:   None known. Axis III:  Patient has persistent nausea and vomiting which has decreased in both  Frequency and tendency when she went on a LOA.  She is currently being Followed by a GI Specialist Axis IV:   Job stressors.  Recent separation from husband. Axis V: GAF   55  PLAN:   As the patient does not meet criteria for depression or anxiety disorder, the patient will most likely not benefit from any scheduled psychotropics dealing with depression or anxiety symptoms.  However, the patient would benefit from a medication to help calm her when she is frustrated on a prn basis.  Therefore, will start Lorazepam, 0.5 \u2013 1 mg daily prn agitation or severe anxiety symptoms. The patient will continue individual therapy with her private therapist.  I advised the patient to go back to her therapist to restructure the therapy so that patient could identify her triggers and to learn more adaptive coping skills to deal with her stressors.  I advised the patient if she needs a therapist with more skills with regard to dealing with anxiety and depressive symptoms, then I would refer her to a PhD psychologist with expertise with anxiety and depressive symptoms.  However at this time, the patient will remain with her current therapist to see if this therapist can help her with identifying triggers and learning more adaptive coping skills. I will follow the patient longitudinally over the next couple of months to monitor her symptoms as she continues to be at risk of developing depression and anxiety disorder. The patient will follow up with her GP and with the GI specialist to continue to look for organic etiology of her GI complaints. The patient is currently looking at leaving the GIS and going back to patrol work as the hours are more predictable and much less stressful Return to clinic in one month for follow up."

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:   The patient is a 10 year old female who is currently in Grade 5.   She lives with her mother in Lower Sackville, NS.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:  Assessment of anxiety symptoms.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .   Mother reports that the patient exhibits multiple depressive symptoms, and the mother believes these anxiety symptoms are affecting her functioning.  Mother first noticed these symptoms about 2 years ago.  In Grade 4, the patient struggled academically.  She had trouble getting her work done and found that her school work was overwhelming.  She had trouble with Math and needed accommodation with her academics.  Mother reports that the patient is not happy most of the time.  She does get aggressive at times with her younger sibling, but does not otherwise present with any other behavioral problems at school.  In fact, she is very quiet in school and hardly interacts with other children.  The screen for child anxiety related disorders, the SCARED, was administered to both the parent and patient on August 2, 2011 by .  Mother scored the patient having a total score of 48 which is in the clinical range whereas the patient only scored a 16, which is not in the clinical range.  This difference in reporting also manifested itself at the appointment today.  Although the mother reported that the patient had multiple anxiety symptoms, the patient was very shy and minimized any problems she may be experiencing.  In fact, the patient hardly spoke during the interview, and answered yes and no, shakes of the head, nodding or shaking her head no. However, mother reports that patient frequently tells her about her worries.  The patient apparently worries about going to school and also when she gets frightened, her heart beats fast.  The patient also has problems being with people she doesn\u2019t know well and worries about people liking her.  When I tried to further interview the patient regarding these fears and worries, the patient denied all of them and claimed there were no problems.  There has been a question of separation anxiety although the patient was able to go to daycare and Grade Primary without any separation difficulties.  Again, the patient denies being worried that something might happen to her mother, but then again, she denied everything up to this point.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   The patient currently sees her guidance counselor, mostly related to school functioning.   Cognitive testing was completed but not available today for appointment.  Mother stated that the cognitive test revealed that she had anxiety symptoms and possible symptoms of ADHD, although  isn\u2019t concerned about any attentional problems.  If anything, the mother states that the patient appeared inhibited and over controlled in her behaviors and not necessarily distractible and impulsive.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   The patient is healthy and has no chronic medical problems.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    None.  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother has anxiety and depression and is currently on Effexor.  Maternal uncle with anxiety and depression.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with her parents and 6 year old brother in .  The parents have been married for 17 years.  Dad is a supervisor for a technology company.  Mother is employed as a part time cleaner.  She also spends most of her time at home caring for the children   They do have a medical plan. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   The patient is a 10 year old female.  She was polite and had good hygiene.  She hardly spoke at the interview and was very shy.  Her thought form was difficult to assess as she hardly spoke.  Also her thought content was not assessed properly as she was not able to talk about her thoughts and feelings. IMPRESSION:   10 year old female who has a history and presentation suggestive of an anxiety disorder.  However, the patient was not able to talk about her thoughts and feelings and minimized everything.  Will need to gather more collateral and longitudinal information to aid with diagnosis and treatment planning.  The differential diagnosis will include Anxiety Disorder, ADD, and learning disability.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Consider Anxiety Disorder nos.  Rule out ADD.  Rule out learning disability. Axis II:   None known Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   Social.  Academic Axis V: GAF = 55  PLAN:   Will refer the patient to  for further assessment and diagnostic clarification.  The patient needs to see a psychologist regularly so that she can warm up to this therapist in order for the therapist to obtain data regarding her internal states and her thoughts.  At this time the patient is not ready to share her thoughts and feelings, so this would be best done with the therapeutic relationship with a therapist. If  believes that the patient has target symptoms which necessitates medication treatment, then  will refer patient back to me for a medication evaluation at that time. I have not scheduled another appointment for the patient as I will await  assessment before proceeding with psychiatric care."

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:    Patient has not been well for the past two years.  Patient has a history of Asthma.  He had a concussion in 2009 which occurred from a closed head injury when he slipped on the ice.

Patient most likely has an adjustment disorder with anxiety symptoms.  At this time, adjustment disorder is at the top of the differential as patient has had multiple stressors over the past couple of years and patient\u2019s ability to cope has not kept up with the overwhelming stress.

Will increase Clonazepam to 0.5 mg tid for severe anxiety symptoms.  Patient may also have 0.5 mg daily prn for severe anxiety.  The plan is to continue Clonazepam scheduled for another few weeks until his anxiety symptoms are attenuated and then at that time, the Clonazepam will be tapered and eventually discontinued.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  The patient is a 10 year old male who recently completed Grade 4 and will be going into Grade 5 in .  Grade 5 is in the middle school.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:  Assessment of inattention and impact on his learning.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .  The patient had psycho educational testing done by the Regional School Board in December, 2008.  At that time, the psychologist recommended the patient be sent to a pediatrician to rule out inattention as a possible contributing factor to his cognitive deficits.  The patient was subsequently referred to , a pediatrician in  who felt that the ADD was sub clinical.   did refer him to the Developmental Clinic at the  for a second opinion.  He was assessed without new testing by .  Again the psycho educational testing was reviewed and  felt that the inattention and was best explained by his cognitive function. In the end, the patient was not diagnosed with ADD and no stimulant medications were trialed.  Repeat testing revealed that patient had significant deficits in reading and math.  However, the parents feel the patient has not been learning over the years as he has difficulty paying attention in class and has difficulty completing his homework.  The patient apparently has difficulty following directions both at home and at school, and gets overwhelmed when he is expected to follow directions that have multiple tasks.  The patient just completed Grade 4 however, his teachers opined that he does not listen and the school work is not registering with him.  They also have noted that he is easily distractible.   At school, an IPP is being suggested as patient is struggling academically.  There is a question of a learning disability in Math and Reading, however recent testing questioned if ADHD may be a contributing factor to his low scores on testing.  In school he is underachieving and parents believe that he is not performing to his full potential due to his inattention.  At home, he is hyperactive and is constantly fidgeting.  He has difficulty sitting still in his chair.  He is easily frustrated and has difficulty with transitions.  Parents report he has a low frustration tolerance.  Patient has good sleep patterns and a good appetite.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   The patient had assessments by two pediatricians who did not opine that patient had ADHD and that his symptoms were sub clinical.  He has never been treated with psychotropic medications.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   No current medical problems.  Patient is healthy.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Antihistamine.  Nasal spray.  ALLERGIES:  Penicillin  FAMILY HISTORY:     There is a paternal first cousin with ADHD and is not doing well in school.  Paternal grandfather had learning problems in school.  A paternal second cousin with learning problems.  There is also a maternal uncle with attentional problems.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient apparently excels at hockey and is competitive.  However, on the ice, father states that he loses his train of thought at times in which he would go after the puck and then goes off of it as if distracted by something else.  Father is employed as a service technician at a window company.   Mother is a biologist.   Patient lives with his parents and 7 year old brother.  The family has supplemental health insurance.  No history of separation anxiety. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   The patient is a pleasant 10 year old male.  He did not exhibit any disrupted behaviors in the office.  He had good eye contact and was able to attend to the interview.  No abnormal body movements noted.  No tics noted.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  His affect was euthymic.  Mood stable.  Thought form was logical.  Thought content, patient denied suicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  IMPRESSION:   10 year old male who has been assessed by two pediatricians who did not feel that he met criteria for ADHD.  However, with repeat testing that revealed severe learning problems in Reading and Math, the question was raised whether the patient\u2019s inability to focus was contributing to his low scores in testing and to his poor academic achievement.  The parents do report that the patient does have distractibility and poor concentration both at home and at school.  The parents appear to be reliable and credible historians.  Therefore, from the history that the parents give, we will treat presumptively for ADHD, inattentive type.  The inattentive type of ADHD is very difficult to diagnose as these patients often times do not have disruptive behaviors that are associated with the hyperactivity and impulsivity of the combined type of this disorder.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Consider ADHD, inattentive type.  Consider co morbid learning disability  in Reading and Mathematics. Axis II:   None known Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   Problems at school.  Problems at home. Axis V: GAF = 55  PLAN:   Will start Biphentin 20 mg qam for ADHD symptoms.   Will need to gather more collateral and longitudinal information to aid with diagnosis and treatment planning.  Will especially need to get the input from his teachers in Grade 5.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  The patient is an almost 19 year old female who recently moved to  with her mother and 15 year old sister.  She graduated from high school in 2010, and has not been employed since June, 2010.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:  Ongoing psychiatric management.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by , the patient\u2019s psychiatrist in .  The patient, her mother and 15 year old sister moved to  one week ago from Victoria, BC.  The patient has been followed by , a child and adolescent psychiatrist, who had diagnosed the patient with Bipolar Type II Disorder with treatment resistant major depressive episodes.   also diagnosed the patient with parent/child relational conflict and perfectionistic personality traits.  The patient had been seeing  for ongoing management and Dr. Gunn referred the patient to me for ongoing psychiatric care.  The patient had good premorbid functioning until Grade 11 when she apparently \u201ccrashed\u201d.  At that time she quit attending school.  She reports feeling depressed starting in Grade 10.  She was apparently stressed by her provincial exams and apparently was very high achieving.  She states she was in approximately 10 extracurricular activities and wanted to keep busy as she is perfectionistic.  In Grade 11, she continued to have multiple extracurricular activities and continued to be stressed by school mainly because she wanted to be perfect.  Also in Grade 11, there were significant stressors in that the parents had marital problems and they separated.  The patient stated she went into a depressive episode in Grade 11 and this lasted into Grade 12.  The patient stated that when she had that last depressive episode, she did have some suicidal ideation, but never had any suicidal intent.  Because the patient did so well previously in school, she received her high school diploma without having to return to school full time.  While she was depressed, she reported she was socially isolated and could not function.   PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   The patient initially starting seeing  in Grade 11 when she had her depressive episode.  The patient was subsequently switched to  as  could no longer see adult patients.  Therefore,  took over for the past year.  The patient has had multiple trials of psychotropic medication.  She has had trials of Cipralex, Prozac and other unknown antidepressants.  As she only had a partial response to Prozac, the patient was augmented with Lithium in June, 2010.  The patient had improved mood with the initiation of Lithium.   When the patient was switched to  care, he discontinued Prozac and started Wellbutrin.  However, this led to worsening anxiety attacks.  The patient was eventually started on Gabapentin for anxiety attacks and Lamotrigine for her depressive episodes.  She was also started on Modafinil as she stated this helped to improve her concentration.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Patient has chronic pain in both arms secondary to repetitive strain injury.  She currently has no family doctor as she recently moved to .  The patient also has hypo thyroidism, presumably secondary to Lithium therapy.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Lithium Carbonate, 600 mg bid.  Modafinil, 150 mg qam.  Lamotrigine, 200 mg qhs.  Gabapentin, 200 mg bid.  Tryptopham, 1- 3 grams qhs prn.  Ativan, 0.5 -1 mg prn.  Synthroid, 0.075 mg daily.  FAMILY HISTORY:     Father with history of depression.  Father\u2019s parents with history of depression.  Mother\u2019s father with depression.  Mother has a history of depression.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mother is employed in the military and the patient and her 15 year old sister have moved to  as mother is posted her.  The patient\u2019s parents have recently divorced.  The patient has an interest in sociology and psychology.  She plans to enroll at Mount St. Vincent\u2019s University in .  She has been unemployed since June, 2010 MENTAL STATUS EXAM:     The patient was pleasant and cooperative throughout the interview.  She had good eye contact.  Good hygiene.  No abnormal body movements noted.  Her speech exhibited normal patterns.  No pressured speech noted.  She was alert and oriented.  Affect was euthymic.  Mood was stable.  Thought form was logical.  Thought content, patient denied suicidal ideations, denied homicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  The patient reports her moods have been stable over the past few months and she reports she is ready to go back to school.   IMPRESSION:     Nearly 19 year old female who has a history of Bipolar Type II Disorder and Anxiety Disorder.  Recently moved from Victoria to Halifax with her family and now needs ongoing psychiatric care.  The patient reports stable moods over the last few months and reports her anxiety symptoms are minimal.  However, I am concerned about poly pharmacy at this time.  It appears that she may be experiencing side effects from all of her medications, particularly she may be exhibiting psychic numbing with Lithium Carbonate, Lamotrigine, and Gabapentin, and therefore the patient was prescribed Modafinil to deal with her poor concentration which may be secondary to the psychic numbing.  As the patient is exhibiting normal moods and is planning to return to school, we will look at tapering and discontinuing her medications to obtain baseline symptoms.  The patient appears to be in remission from any mood episodes.  Will need to gather more longitudinal and collateral information to aid with diagnosis and treatment planning.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Bipolar Type II Disorder by history.  Anxiety Disorder by history. Axis II:   Deferred Axis III:  Hypo thyroidism presumably secondary to Lithium treatment Axis IV:   Unemployed.  Has not been in school for the past year. Axis V: GAF = 60  PLAN:   Will decrease Gabapentin to 100 mg bid for 3 days, then decrease to 100 mg qhs for 3 days, then discontinue as patient reports she has no significant anxiety symptoms at this time. Will consider discontinuing Modafinil at the next visit. Will continue Lithium and Lamotrigine at current dosages at this time for mood stabilization. Will discontinue Tryptophan. Will continue Ativan prn. Will continue Synthroid 0.075 mg daily Return to clinic in one month for follow up. I encouraged the patient to get a family doctor to address her medical problems."

The patient has exhibited worsening moods and behaviors over the past several months.  His mother has noted that he becomes frustrated easily and has meltdowns when he previously was a well behaved child.  Patient says he is overwhelmed at times and blames his mother as she feels she is critical of him.  He also has problems with sleep which actually has been ongoing through the years.  He has initial insomnia which lasts approximately 2-3 hours before he is asleep.  He also has multiple early morning awakenings and takes approximately an hour to get back to sleep.  He wakes up the next day and does not feel rested.  He also has a poor appetite and only eats when he is hungry.  Mother has been concerned as patient has been more emotional since November, 2010, when her and her ex-husband separated.  However, when I interviewed patient alone regarding his mood symptoms, he tended to minimize his symptoms.  He states he does have low moods at times but it does not last the whole day.   He states they only last 1-2 days at most and his moods return to normal.  He denies every having low moods lasting more than two weeks.   He denies any feelings of guilt and denies any hopeless feelings.  He reports his concentration is adequate and he continues to make straight A\u2019s in school.  He denies ever having any suicidal ideations, and when I asked him about this, he was quite surprised that I would even asked him.  Mother states that patient is having more meltdowns and is quite isolative to home.  He is also less active physically over the last two months.  When asked about the separation, he stated this was not a problem.  However, mother worries that patient is having difficulty transitioning as he does not have a regular schedule at both households as mother works as a psychiatric nurse on an inpatient unit, and therefore has irregular hours.  When mother is home, patient goes to her home, when she is working, he goes to his father\u2019s.   fortunately, the separation has been \u201camicable\u201d and patient has been able to remain at the same school and keep the same friends as mother only moved a mile away and is living with her parents.   Patient was not able to give details about his sleep problems.  He was not able to think of anything that interfered with his sleep.  He does snores but denies any headaches on awakening.   No evidence of narcolepsy.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:     Patient has never seen a psychiatrist.  He has never been on psychotropic medications.  Patient saw  when he was 8 years old.  He saw her for counseling as he was bullied in Grade 2.  Patient has recently refused to see  as he doesn\u2019t find it helpful any longer.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:     Asthma.  No history of head injuries.  He has just started puberty.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    None  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother has a history of depression and is currently on Fluoxetine.  Maternal grandmother has a history of depression and was on medication.  Paternal aunt with a history of depression and anxiety and was previously on Paroxetine.  SOCIAL HISTORY:    Parents separated in November, 2010.  Mother lives in the in-law suite at her parents.  Father kept family home.  Patient is an only child.  He started to get bullied in Grade 1 and 2 by classmates.  Mother is employed as a Psychiatric Nurse at the .  Father works in IT with HITS .

The patient currently does not meet criteria for a major depressive disorder.  The patient has problems with insomnia, low activity level and poor appetite which may also be contributing to his mood symptoms.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood most likely.  Rule out emerging depression Axis II:   None known Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   History of bullying.  Separation of parents. Axis V: GAF  = 60  PLAN:  No antidepressant medications indicated at this time as patient doesn\u2019t currently meet criteria for depression.  However, patient is at risk for eventually developing depression if he continues to isolate himself, does not eat properly and does not get adequate sleep. That patient is currently refusing to go to therapy at this time.  As patient is quite young, the behavioural approaches may work better.  I went over behavioural approaches with mother to help the patient at home.  For example, mother will look at patient\u2019s activity level and will incorporate it into family outings so that the whole family could be more active.  Also, mother will look into helping patient with sleep hygiene techniques.  Mother will also look into Melatonin to help him for initial insomnia.  If Melatonin is helpful, will continue Melatonin scheduled at night for a few months.  After a couple of months of good sleep, can then switch Melatonin to prn basis.   At this time, I do not plan on seeing the patient again.  However, if the patient has worsening depressive symptoms, then consider re-referring to my clinic. Thank you very much for your referral.  Sincerely,"

Since the last visit the patient reports worsening anxiety symptoms.  She stated with the decrease of Clonazepam from 2mg qid to 2 mg tid, she had worsening anxiety symptoms, felt nauseous and also was fidgety and couldn\u2019t sit still.  She also had worsening anxiety attacks.  Also, the restlessness and not being able to sit still and not being able to focus started when she started Abilify.

She has had Paxil, Venlafaxine, Trazodone, Lorazepam, Bromazepam, Valproic Acid, Ritalin, Sertraline, Citalopram, Mirtazapine, and Seroquel.  Today I explained to the patient that she has developed a dependence on Clonazepam as she now has tolerance and requires very high doses to treat her anxiety symptoms and when she tries to reduce the Clonazepam, she has withdrawal symptoms.  It also appears that she may have been activated by Abilify.  IMPRESSION:   The patient appears to have withdrawal symptoms with the decrease of Clonazepam and also appears to have some activation with Ability.  No acute safety  issues noted. PLAN:   Will increase Clonazepam back to the previous dosage of 2 mg qid  for severe anxiety.  The patient has a dependence on Clonazepam and eventually needs to taper this medication.  At this time, the patient is too unstable to start to taper. Will decrease Abilify to 1 mg daily secondary to being activated by the higher dosage of Abilify.  The target dose for the patient may be as low as 2 mg daily of Abilify as we are trying to target treatment resistant depression.

The patient presents as very slow in his thinking and appears to have difficulty understanding abstract concepts.  He is concrete and appears to have the emotional maturity level of a much younger child.  If the patient does indeed have global cognitive deficits, then the patient has minimal control over the sexualized behaviors, especially since patient is now in puberty.  At this time, patient does not meet criteria for a psychotic disorder and does not meet criteria for ADHD.  He does appear to have mental retardation which needs to be confirmed with formal psycho educational testing.  DIAGNOSIS: Axis I:   Learning Disability by history.  No evidence of Psychosis or ADHD.  No evidence of Anxiety Disorder Axis II:   Probable mental retardation Axis III:  History of 22q11 Deletion Syndrome Axis IV:   Problems at school.  Problems relating with peers Axis V: GAF   = 50 PLAN:   As patient does not have a psychotic disorder and does not meet criteria for a mood or anxiety disorder, no psychotropics are recommended at this time. It is recommended that patient receive formal psycho education testing to rule out mental retardation. I do not plan to see patient again as patient does not require psychiatric care.  The most important intervention now is to refer patient to a psychologist to perform psycho educational testing. The school plan needs to change significantly.  I recommend that the patient be transferred to smaller classes and assigned a one to one tutor.   These recommendations would be especially important if testing confirms that he has mental retardation.  Thanks for your referral.  If you have any more questions, please call my office at ."

CURRENT MEDICATION:   Zoloft, 100 mg daily.  The patient is a 12 year old male who has a history of ADHD and possible depression and PTSD.  The patient has tolerated the decrease of Zoloft without side effects. There has been no change in his symptoms.  He continues to have highly disruptive behaviors.  He continues to be impulsive, hyperactive, and interrupts frequently.  He also continues to have a low frustration tolerance and is difficult to redirect.  In the session today, the patient frequently interrupted and became quite upset when he was redirected.  He had difficulty sitting still in his chair.  The patient continues to live at the group home.  Mother stated that the patient attempted to harm himself last week in response to being redirected for his disruptive behaviors. Patient denied he had suicidal intent and denied any current suicidal ideations.  Today we went over strategies to help contain the patient\u2019s behaviors. I also advised the mother to talk with the group home workers that if he had self harm behaviors again that they would either call me, and if I could not be reached immediately, that they would take the patient to the ER at the  for urgent assessment.  IMPRESSION:   What is most prominent now is the patient\u2019s highly disruptive behaviors which appear to be more related to oppositional defiant disorder and ADHD rather than a mood disorder.  The patient had recent self harm behaviors but currently denies any suicidal ideations.  There are no acute safety issues at this time.  PLAN:  Will continue to reduce Zoloft to 50 mg daily for one week and then decrease to 25 mg for one week and then discontinue.

The patient will eventually need stimulant treatment to treat his ADHD symptoms.  However, his impulsive aggression and mood lability need to be addressed first with a mood stabilizer.

He no longer has aggressive outbursts.  Initially when he was placed on Abilify, he had day time sedation but this has lessened.  I spoke with the Child Protection worker today and she stated that it appears that the parent/child conflict has been the primary driver for the patient\u2019s disruptive behaviors.  However, I did state to the Child Protection worker that the patient may be responding to the Abilify as it does have mood stabilizing properties. I did speak with the patient\u2019s parents today and they did understand that the patient is doing better in the foster home and that they understood that the patient apparently responds to structure.

Today I met with the patient and the patient\u2019s mother and father.  The patient continues to be frustrated by his parent\u2019s conflicts, and acts out his frustrations by being oppositional and defiant, holding much resentment towards his parents.  I reiterated to the parents that the patient\u2019s anxiety disorder is stable, and that he is responding to pharmacotherapy and the therapy provided by .  However, the parents have a difference of opinion on that issue.  Mother believes that the patient needs continued focus on his mental health, as the patient has been exhibiting irritability and verbal outbursts.  In addition, the patient has a low frustration tolerance and has black and white thinking, contributing to the disruptive behaviours.  Mother believes that this is indicative of worsening mental illness.  However, the father believes that these behaviours are due to the context of the environment, and that he does not observe these behaviours at his home.  I explained to the parents that these differences in opinions are indicative of the lack of co-parenting and cooperation between the parents, and that their continued parental conflicts will only lead to more acting-out behaviours from the patient.  I also explained that my role as the psychiatrist is to monitoring the patient\u2019s response to medication for his anxiety symptoms, which are currently stable.  Furthermore, it is difficult to reconcile the differences of each family member\u2019s opinion of the problem, and therefore a solution is never obtained, given that the mental health focus has been solely on the treatment of the patient\u2019s internal symptoms (anxiety), and that the external pathology has not been successfully addressed in outpatient settings with other clinicians.  Given this, I am referring this patient and his family to the  program at the , where they can assess the home environments of each household, and then attempt to unify the parents to start co-parenting and to put their differences aside for the sake of their son\u2019s future mental health.

It appears that there are significant legal issues here that need to be addressed in a separate venue.  I explained to the mother that this is a private medical practice and that my responsibilities are only to the patient.  To be fair to both parents, I will invite the patient\u2019s father Brian to come for a visit in the next couple of weeks along with his partner Lisa, to gather their side of the story.  I will also meet with the patient at a future visit to explain that I have invited to meet with his father and have met with his mother, and the purpose would be to gather collateral information regarding his mental health treatment."

Patient also has had other behaviors including avoiding tiles or lines on the floor and also the first step on staircases he encountered.  He also claimed at the time he must adhere to certain rules to avoid internal commotion.  These behaviors were often triggered by stressful situations.  Prior to seeing , the patient had no previous psychiatric history and had never been on psychotropic medications.   diagnosed the patient with OCD and recommended a trial of Fluoxetine to help with his OCD symptoms.  He also was to follow up with a private therapist, Roger Godin, for cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD.  No psychiatric follow up was scheduled and therefore  followed the patient.  The patient was started on Fluoxetine and it was eventually titrated to 60 mg.

Biological mother is employed as a realtor; biological father is employed in the insurance industry.  The patient is a competitive hockey lacrosse player.  He states his mother prevents him from further competing in hockey and lacrosse as he wants to have more coaching and practice.  The patient states he was accepted to the national lacrosse team but his inability to attend practices distresses him highly and he blames his mother for this.

  "content": "Psychiatric Clinic Note  DOB : 02/03/1998 Date of clinic visit: September 8, 2011  The patient was seen with his mother for a follow up visit to psychiatry clinic.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Fluoxetine, 40 mg daily.  The patient is a 13 year old male with history of OCD and parent/child relational conflict.  The patient reports his anxiety symptoms are stable.  Mother states that her relationship with her son has improved over the summer.  Mother and mother\u2019s partner have made concerted efforts to connect with the patient.  They went away on vacation and are starting to have fun together.  However, patient continues to be inflexible and has black and white thinking.  This propensity to be inflexible may have to do with his anxiety disorder as he often gets quite upset when people do not \u201ctell the truth\u201d, when in fact what people discuss with him are their perspectives but apparently he only sees things from his perspective, then they are wrong and they are lying.  He often accuses his mother and her partner of lying when in fact they have different viewpoints than what he sees.  The patient denies any side effects of his medications.  Today we went over strategies to help mother to connect better with the patient and to contain his behaviours.  Mother and the patient have recently started family therapy to work on their relationship.  Mother reports this is somewhat helpful.  Today I met with mother to discuss the referral to the ICBTT.  That program did not believe that the patient had the criteria for their program.  I encouraged mother to continue with family therapy as this is most likely the best route as the patient is stable and most likely has communication issues with mother and her partner.  IMPRESSION:  The relationship between the patient and his mother are improving.  However, the patient continues to have inflexible and black and white thinking.  PLAN:  Will continue Fluoxetine 40 mg daily for OCD. Patient and his mother will continue with family therapy to address the communication issues with the family.  Patient will also continue individual therapy with Heather McLatchey for CBT. At this time, the patient does not have any active psychiatric symptoms.  I would recommend that the patient continues on Fluoxetine 40 mg daily until the summer of 2012.  If he does not have any significant anxiety symptoms at that time, then consider tapering and eventually discontinuing Fluoxetine at that time. I have not scheduled another appointment, as the patient is currently stable and is closely followed by .  Should you have any question about the patient in the future, then please contact my office at . The patient will follow-up with  for medication management."

She has had multiple antidepressants including Paxil, Prozac, Wellbutrin, and most recently had a trial of Abilify.  They have not been effective for her depression or her mood swings.  The patient was a very poor historian today and therefore it required mother to join the patient as the patient could not recall any of her symptoms.  She does report she has depressed mood and mood swings but could not elaborate on her other mood symptoms.  She does report a history of anxiety attacks characterized by chest pains, tightness, and flushing.  Otherwise, she reports her sleep is normal with her sleeping pills.  She reports adequate energy level.  She has a history of passive intermittent suicidal ideations.  The patient also reports generalized worries and reports these anxiety attacks occur daily.

The patient was previously living with her parents but moved in with her boyfriend two weeks ago. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   The patient was somewhat aloof and confused at the interview.  She was a poor historian and therefore most of the history had to be gathered by the patient\u2019s mother.  The patient did appear to have somewhat of an oppositional feel to her as she blatantly refused to answer questions that someone of her age should be able to answer, such as how her moods were over the past couple of weeks or how her sleep was over the past couple of weeks.   She often turned to her mother to see if she could answer the questions for her.  Otherwise, her speech exhibited normal patterns.

Prior to that, the patient had good premorbid functioning.  At the age of 22, she exhibited social phobia as she had a fear of social scrutiny and avoided social situations.   This lasted two months and was treated successfully with Cipralex at that time.  She states her anxiety symptoms would recur in the summertime but would eventually go away.  She again has social phobia which has lasted for the past 5 weeks.  She was previously employed as a server at a restaurant but at work she was having severe anxiety symptoms in which she had fear of social scrutiny and could not make eye contact with any of her customers.  She therefore quit work 5 weeks ago.  Now the thought of returning to work induces anxiety attacks characterized by diaphoresis, extreme nervousness, rapid heartbeat, and experiencing pins and needles in her extremities, which last for up to 10 minutes.  Now her anxiety has now affected her ability to drive.  She said when she was driving a few weeks ago, she was indecisive and was dangerous on the road and therefore does not drive.

She reports low energy level, poor concentration, and poor appetite.  She denies any suicidal ideations.  In fact, she had a hard time coming to the appointment today as she spends much time avoiding social situations and isolates herself at home.  The patient was restarted on Cipralex which was titrated up to 20 mg daily.  However, this was not effective and therefore this was switched to Zoloft which was titrated quickly to 200 mg daily.  However, she experienced more anxiety symptoms on high dosage Zoloft and when she was titrated to 200 mg she experienced headaches, increased anxiousness and feeling jittery.  She therefore decreased the dose to 150 mg but still experiences some of these side effects.  She has been on Zoloft now for the past month.  In addition, she has been prescribed Ativan, 1 mg bid or tid prn severe anxiety symptoms.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:    The patient first saw a psychiatrist at the age of 14.

She woke up at her parents\u2019 house.  Her father became very concerned and took patient to an AA meeting.  The patient stated she again drank the next day and attended another AA meeting that day.  The patient reports she currently has problems with drinking as she states that it is one of the ways to deal with her anxiety.  She still is having significant anxiety symptoms and is still avoiding social situations.  Today I counselled the patient on strategies to reduce her use of alcohol as over the long term, her use of alcohol will only make her anxiety symptoms worse.   I also had the patient go home to make a list of social situations and to rank them with regard to how anxiety provoking they are.  I told her to start at the social situation that was the least anxiety provoking and to work her way up.  I reassured her that her medications that are currently prescribed are reducing her anxiety symptoms now so that she can expose herself to the social situations that she is avoiding.  I also explained to her that avoiding these social situations will only make her anxiety worse over the long term. IMPRESSION:  Social phobia with co morbid alcohol abuse.  The patient continues to have significant anxiety symptoms and continues to abuse alcohol.  She did state she would make an effort to reduce her use of alcohol and also stated she would consider seeing a therapist.  PLAN:   I encouraged the patient to continue going to AA meetings as this can help her to reduce her use of alcohol. Will refer the patient to  for individual therapy.   Will continue her current medications at current dosages at this time.  I explained to the patient that if she continues to drink heavily, she should not be taking Clonazepam.  She agreed to this.

CURRENT MEDICATION:    Clonazepam, 0.5 mg tid and 0.5 mg daily prn for anxiety.    The patient is a 23 year old female with history of Bipolar Type II Disorder.  The patient did not take the Abilify as prescribed earlier this week as the patient was concerned she would gain weight as she had researched the literature and saw case reports where patients had gained significant weight while on Abilify.  Despite my continued reassurance that Abilify was weight neutral, especially when compared to other choices in mood stabilizers, the patient did not believe me and most of the session today was spent on the patient\u2019s worries and fears of gaining weight while on this medication.  The patient became very tearful during the interview as she felt ganged up on, therefore the mother and her sister left the room and the patient was only with the underwriter and her father towards the end of the interview.  The patient was then able to take in the fact that Abilify has less risk of weight gain than the other mood stabilizers.  After much reassurance by the underwriter and her father, the patient was eventually able to come to the conclusion that she does need to take a mood stabilizer to stabilize her moods and agreed, after quite a long time, that she would take the Abilify.  She also agreed to start counseling with a therapist. IMPRESSION:    Bipolar Type II Disorder.  The patient was able to get over her fears about Ability causing weight gain.  She did finally agree to start Abilify and to see a therapist.  PLAN:  Will start Abilify, 1 mg daily for 3 days then increase to 3 mg daily thereafter for mood stabilization.

Patient also had a trial of Effexor but it made her more anxious and more irritable.  The patient has been off of all psychotropics since the New Year 2011.

No psychomotor changes noted.  She was alert and oriented.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  Her affect was slightly dysthymic.  Mood low.  Though form was logical thought content.  Patient denied any suicidal ideations.  Denied homicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.   IMPRESSION:    23 year old female who has a history and presentation consistent with diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and Anorexia Nervosa.  The patient does not meet criteria for Bipolar Disorder although there are two distant relatives with Bipolar Disorder, and the patient has a loaded family history of mood disorders.  Although the patient is highly functional and has recently finished university, she continues to struggle with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and Anorexia Nervosa.  She has had numerous trials of SSRI\u2019s and SNRI\u2019s which have either been not effective or partially effective for her depressive and anxiety symptoms.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, moderate.  Anxiety Disorder NOS,  consider Generalized Anxiety Disorder.   Anorexia Nervosa by history. Axis II:   Deferred Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   Few friends Axis V: GAF  = 60  PLAN:   It does not appear that the patient\u2019s anxiety symptoms have been adequately addressed.  Therefore, will start patient on Clonazepam up to 0.5 mg po tid for control of anxiety symptoms for the short term. Once the patient\u2019s anxiety symptoms are under control, then will start another SSRI such as Cipralex for control of the depressive and anxiety symptoms over the long term. Should the patient not respond fully to the combination of Clonazepam and Cipralex, then consider augmenting the patient with Abilify in the future, low dose, as this can help to address treatment resistant depression and also can help to alleviate mood lability and anxiety symptoms not amenable to SSRI treatment. The patient will eventually need individual therapy utilizing cognitive behaviour therapy to address her anxiety and depressive symptoms.  Will discuss this at a future visit as the group treatment for her Anorexia Nervosa is not helping. Return to clinic in one to two weeks for immediate follow up."

  "content": "Psychiatric Clinic Note  DOB : 05/05/1988 Date of evaluation: June 30, 2011  The patient was seen for a follow up visit to psychiatry clinic.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Clonazepam, 0.5 mg tid.   The patient is a 23 year old female who has a history of Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and Anorexia Nervosa.   The patient reports she has tolerated the initiation of Clonazepam without side effects.  In fact, she reports significant improvement of her anxiety symptoms with Clonazepam.  She reports she has less nervousness and has less social phobia.  She reports she is able to go into public and into crowds and feels more comfortable doing so.  She also reports she is sleeping better.  The patient also reports she has less eating disorder behaviors.  She reports she is purging less.  She used to purge two times per day and is currently only purging twice a week.  She also reports she is less anxious about food intake and also about her self image.  However, the patient continues to have depressive symptoms and apprehensions about the future.  She is currently having problems with her relationship.  She states her boyfriend is too dependent on her and she would like for him to become more independent and get a job.  The patient states she feels smothered by him and would like to go separate ways to become independent and pursue their goals.   However, the patient states her boyfriend does not want to leave her and the patient feels guilty about suggesting that they become more independent.    Today I counseled the patient that much of her anxiety and depressive symptoms do stem around interpersonal problems such as her relationship with her boyfriend and decisions about what to do about relationships in the future.  Although her symptoms are being targeted with medication, I stated to her that her interpersonal problems need to be addressed or else she will continue to have symptoms that are not amenable to medication treatment.  The patient seemed to have insight around this and stated that she would eventually like to see a counselor to address interpersonal issues that are triggering and perpetuating her anxiety and depressive symptoms.  However, at this time she states she would like to continue with Clonazepam as she states she is able to go out in public and be more social without having so much anxiety symptoms.  At this time she did not want to consider taking Cipralex as she was somewhat apprehensive about all of the side effects she has had on numerous antidepressants in the past.  MENTAL STATUS EXAM:  The patient was pleasant and cooperative.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  Affect was brighter.  Mood improving.  Thought form was logical.  Thought content, patient denied any suicidal ideations, denied homicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  IMPRESSION:    Anxiety Disorder, nos.  Anorexia Nervosa.  Major Depressive Disorder.  The patient has exhibited significant improvement of anxiety symptoms with the initiation of Clonazepam.  She is also exhibiting less avoidant behaviors and is becoming more social.  The patient continues to have anxiety and depressive symptoms which appear to be perpetuated by her interpersonal problems, especially with her boyfriend.  PLAN:   Will continue Clonazepam, 0.5 mg tid and will also add 0.5 mg daily prn for severe anxiety symptoms. Will hold on starting Cipralex now as the patient is apprehensive about starting a new medication due to the side effects she has experienced on antidepressants in the past. Will discuss referring patient to an individual therapist at the next visit. Return to clinic in one month for follow up."

Patient developed H1N1 in Grade 10 and endured a 50 pound weight loss.  Patient has had organic work ups which have been normal.  He has normal thyroid functioning and no metabolic abnormalities according to patient and his mother.  His new medical symptoms are head and neck pain over the past month and the anxiety attacks which have been worsening over the past two weeks.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Clonazepam, 0.5 mg bid for anxiety symptoms.    ALLERGIES:   Possible allergy to Sulpha as sulpha allergies run in the family.  FAMILY HISTORY:   Paternal uncle has schizophrenia and suicided.  There was another paternal uncle with bipolar disorder.  Patient\u2019s paternal grandmother had a \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d.  The patient has a half-brother who is 26 years old and has ADHD.  There is a maternal grandfather with Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.   There is no history of panic disorder, no history of agoraphobia and no history of panic disorder in the family according to mother.

No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.    IMPRESSION:   17 year old male who has a history and presentation consistent with Anxiety Disorder, nos.  Patient most likely has an adjustment disorder with anxiety symptoms.  At this time, adjustment disorder is at the top of the differential as patient has had multiple stressors over the past couple of years and patient\u2019s ability to cope has not kept up with the overwhelming stress.  Also adjustment disorder is more likely than an anxiety disorder as there are no known family members with an anxiety disorder.    However, anxiety disorder will be kept on the differential diagnosis as patient may well go on to develop an anxiety disorder.    DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:    Anxiety Disorder, nos.  Rule out Adjustment Disorder, rule out Anxiety Disorder, ADHD by history Axis II:   None known Axis III:  Head and neck pain over the past month.  History of concussion.  History of multiple infections including H1N1. Axis IV:    School, peers. Axis V: GAF  = 50  PLAN:    At this time we will continue to hold Vyvanse as it has been exacerbating anxiety attacks.  Once patient\u2019s anxiety symptoms are under control we will consider restarting Vyvanse at that time to address patient\u2019s ADHD symptoms. Will increase Clonazepam to 0.5 mg tid for severe anxiety symptoms.  Patient may also have 0.5 mg daily prn for severe anxiety.  The plan is to continue Clonazepam scheduled for another few weeks until his anxiety symptoms are attenuated and then at that time, the Clonazepam will be tapered and eventually discontinued.   Should the patient continue to exhibit sustained anxiety symptoms or if the anxiety symptoms worsen, then consider starting an SSRI such as Zoloft or Luvox to address the anxiety symptoms. Will refer patient for individual therapy to Dr. Marc Blumberg. Return to clinic in one week for immediate follow up."

Today I went over techniques to help the patient cope with her anxiety symptoms.  Today I went over with her the difference between what are anxiety symptoms and obsessive compulsive disorder and what are behaviors.  I helped the patient to understand that if she was spending an inordinate amount of time on her thoughts and being distressed over them, then this is most likely from anxiety.

  "content": "Psychiatric Evaluation  DOB : 18/05/1999 Date of evaluation: May 31, 2011  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:    The patient is a 12 year old female who lives with her parents in .  She is currently in Grade 6.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:    Worsening anxiety symptoms.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:     The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .  The patient has a history of Juvenile Dermatomyositis, for which she was hospitalized to the  on March 12, 2010.  She was subsequently re-admitted for severe back pain and had complications of shingles and pneumonia.   During her hospital treatment last year, she was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and was subsequently discharged on Prednisone, which she remained on until April 26, 2011.    The patient reports anxiety symptoms which had pre-dated her medical problems.   Starting in 2009, the patient started confessing to mother about things that she did in school.  For example, she told her mother she felt guilty for not talking to kids at school and would feel guilt about little things.  At the time, the patient was distressed about these feelings of guilt.  These intrusive thoughts progressively worsened, and eventually the patient had intrusive thoughts that she wished people would die when she got mad at them.  Mother believes that the patient\u2019s medical illness in 2010 distracted her away from these intrusive thoughts.   In January, 2011, the intrusive thoughts progressed.  The intrusive thoughts included content that was sexual, morbid, blasphemy against God, fears of being gay, and fears of hurting herself.  She would confess to her mother that she was having these intrusive thoughts.   Recently she has had intrusive thoughts that she was gay and would be highly distressed about these thoughts.  When the steroids were discontinued last month, the patient\u2019s intrusive thoughts actually worsened and patient has been highly distressed about these thoughts.  To make matters worse, patient finds it harder to tell her mother about these thoughts, which involves her fears of being gay and also fears of harming herself.   The patient is afraid of handling objects that are sharp because she is afraid of harming herself.  She states she has no suicidal intent and has never tried to hurt herself, however she does have intrusive thoughts that she may hurt herself.    The patient denies any rituals to counteract these obsessions.  However, mother states that patient has recently described germ contamination fears and has started some hand washing, although these compulsions do not last for more than one hour.  The patient denies any anxiety attacks.  She denies any social phobia.  She denies any performance anxiety.   The patient does have anticipatory anxiety and worries about going to school and also worries about being away from her parents.  She has ruminating negative thoughts and is frequently unhappy.  However, the patient denies any periods of low moods where she is hopeless.   She reports adequate energy level and reports adequate concentration.  Her sleep patterns have been disrupted by these obsessions.  The patient actually does well in school, she makes A\u2019s and B\u2019s.  She reports the intrusive thoughts occur less often at school as her focus on schoolwork is a good distraction for her and she likes seeing her friends.  However, when she goes home the intrusive thoughts seem to engulf her and she is highly distressed by them.  The patient is the one who requested help for these intrusive thoughts.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:     The patient has never had a psychiatric evaluation.  She was seen by a psychologist at the ,  for treatment.  The patient has been seeing  monthly and has been trying to teach the patient techniques of displacing these intrusive thoughts to a later time.  However, the patient states that these techniques have not been helping.  The patient was referred to the mental health program in  and they have their first appointment with a therapist there on July 31, 2011.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:     History of Juvenile Dermatomyositis and hypertension secondary to steroids.  CURRENT MEDICATION:      Methotrexate, Hydrochlorothiazide, Allopurinol, Cyclosporine, Lisinopril.  The patient also takes various vitamin and mineral supplements including folic acid, potassium citrate, Vitamin D, Calcium and Magnesium.  The patient was recently prescribed Lorazepam, 0.5 mg prn; however, the patient has yet to take a dose for anxiety.   FAMILY HISTORY:    Maternal grandfather with history of depression.  However, there were no other family members with mental health issues that the parents were aware of.  SOCIAL HISTORY:    The patient is in Grade 6.  She had missed much time at school but her teachers and classmates have been accommodating to her.  She has an older brother Trevor, 14, and a younger brother Tyler, 9.  The parents are very dedicated to their children. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:     the patient looks younger than stated age, but when she talks she appears older.  She was pleasant and cooperative during the interview.    She was help seeking and was actually the one that initiated the request to get mental health treatment.  She is obese and has Cushingoid features.  She was alert and oriented.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  She was in fact quite articulate.  Affect was withdrawn.  Mood was stable.  Thought form was logical thought content.  The patient denied any current suicidal ideations, denied homicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.   IMPRESSIONS:     12 year old female who has a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of atypical Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  The patient does not have typical OCD in that the patient does not have compulsive rituals to offset the anxiety associated with the intrusive thoughts.  It appears that the structure of her school and her nurturing family has helped to alleviate much of the distress associated with the intrusive thoughts.  However, the patient is clearly in distress and is finding it more difficult to rely on her mother as she is having intrusive thoughts about being gay and about hurting herself.  The patient does not currently meet criteria for depression although she is at risk for eventually developing this as well.  Currently there are no acute safety issues as patient does not have suicidal intent and has never tried to harm herself.  Patient has apparently had psychotherapy but the patient does not find this helpful as her symptoms are too severe and therapy is not intense enough as the family can only get to Halifax once a month for their IVIG treatments and psychotherapy sessions with   DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Obsessive Compulsive Disorder most likely, with atypical presentation.  Rule out emerging Major Depressive Disorder. Axis II:   None known  Axis III:  Juvenile Dermatomyositis.  Hypertension secondary to steroids Axis IV:   Chronic medical illness Axis V: GAF  = 60    PLAN:   Will start Sertraline 25 mg daily for one week and then increase to 50 mg daily for anxiety symptoms. Will continue Lorazepam, 0.5 mg prn for severe anxiety symptoms. The patient is currently seeing  at the  for psychotherapy on a monthly basis which is coordinated with the patient\u2019s IVIG treatments.  Patient has their first intake appointment with a therapist in the mental health program in  on July 31, 2011. Return to clinic in one month for follow up."

He was assessed to have slow processing and has difficulty with language arts.  Valerie Corkum also diagnosed patient with mild ADHD at the time.  After the psychological evaluation, the patient was sent to Sylvan Learning Centre for tutoring, especially in writing and reading.  Mother is concerned as the patent\u2019s vocabulary is not improving and reading does not come easy for the patient.  He also has a hard time initiating homework and has difficulty focusing.  Mother is concerned as the patient may be exhibiting an underlying attentional problem versus a learning disability.  The patient has had difficulty in school, and in Grade 10 made Bs and Cs.

The patient reports he occasionally daydreams in class, however he denies any forgetfulness and reports he is organized.   He denies any fidgetiness in class and also reports he is not hyperactive.

The patient has never seen a psychiatrist and has never been in counseling.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   No acute medical problems.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    None.

  "content": "Psychiatric Evaluation  DOB : 18/11/2004 Date of evaluation: August 11, 2011 The patient was seen with her parents for a psychiatric evaluation.  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  The patient is nearly 7 year old female who will be attending Grade 1 in September.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:   Aggressive behaviors and anxiety symptoms when on Adderall and Biphentin.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .   wanted to facilitate a second opinion regarding the diagnosis and treatment for the patient\u2019s attentional problems and mood symptoms.  The patient had been followed by  at the .  The patient has cleft palate and speech deficit.  She has chromosomal abnormalities with translocation of 9 and 15 and micro deletion of 9.  The patient has a history of global developmental delay except for the language and social domains.  The patient has had other mid line abnormalities including superior ventricular tachycardia, which has resolved.  The patient is followed by the Cleft Palate team.  The patient also has a history of gastro esophageal reflux.  She is followed by multiple disciplines including physio, OT and speech therapy.  In February, 2011,  diagnosed the patient with ADHD as the patient had significant distractibility and difficulty staying on task despite much accommodation in her school setting.  Within her private school setting, the patient has small classes and also has more individualized attention with her teachers.  Despite these accommodations, the patient continues to have problems focusing and staying on task.  There has been a diagnostic question whether this is ADHD or if the patient is unable to do the work due to her not comprehending it.  The patient had a trial of Biphentin and was not titrated above 10 mg daily. While on Biphentin, the patient had more mood lability, became hyper focused, developed tics, developed insomnia and had appetite suppression.  This was discontinued and the patient had a trial of Adderall.  The patient apparently responded well and had fewer side effects than on Biphentin.  The patient is able to focus better on Adderall and is able to transition better out of activities.  At school they also noticed that she had improved focus while on Adderall.  However, in June 2011, the patient became abstinent, irritable and explosive.  She also was defiant and was difficult to redirect and had difficulty sleeping.  The parents thought this was secondary to the Adderall and therefore Adderall was discontinued.   The parents saw  in July who did not opine that the worsening behaviors were secondary to the meds according to parents.  Off of Adderall, the parents noticed that the patient had worsening attention and impulsivity, but they did note that the mood improved.  However, when patient was discontinued with Adderall, this coincided with the end of school so it is difficult to ascertain where the patient\u2019s behaviors were coming from.  The parents wanted a second opinion regarding diagnosis and treatment plan and therefore they were referred to psychiatry.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   The patient has been followed by Dr. Anne Hawkins and has been diagnosed and treated for ADHD and also has global developmental delay.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   GERD resolved.  Cardiac abnormalities resolved.  Followed by Cleft Palate Team and also by the Developmental Clinic with Dr. Anne Hawkins.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    The patient was recently started on Adderall XR 10 mg qam.  ALLERGIES:    No known drug allergies.  FAMILY HISTORY:   Maternal grandmother with depression.  No other family members with mental illness.  MENTAL STATUS EXAM:    The patient is a 6 year old female who was able to be interviewed alone without having separation anxiety from her parents.  She has good eye contact.  No psychomotor changes noted.  Her gait was grossly normal.  No abnormal body movements noted.  The patient did exhibit blinking of her left eye on a few occasions during interview but no other tics noted.  Her expressive and receptive language appeared grossly intact; however, she does have problems articulating speech and it was difficult to understand what she was saying at times.  Her thought form was concrete.  Thought content: the patient denied any thoughts of self harm.  She denied any separation anxiety.  She denied any generalized worries.  She was able to attend to the interview and answered questions appropriately.  Her affect was euthymic and her mood was stable.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  IMPRESSION:   Nearly 7 year old female who has a history and presentation consistent with diagnoses of ADHD and global developmental delay.  The patient does not meet criteria for any other psychiatric co-morbidities.  It appears that the patient had a better response and less side effects while on Adderall when compared to Biphentin.  The patient\u2019s worsening behaviors in June may not necessarily been due to the medications as the patient does have developmental challenges and may have been overwhelmed in the school setting or at home.  When school ended, the patient\u2019s disruptive behaviors resolved.  It is difficult to determine etiology, but the most likely explanation is that the patient had less stressors with school ending and therefore her behaviors improved.  The patient does not meet criteria for a mood disorder, does not meet criteria for anxiety disorder, and does not meet criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   ADHD Axis II:   Deferrred  Axis III:  Global developmental delay with chromosomal abnormalities with  Translocation of 9 and 15 and micro deletion of 9. Axis IV:   Learning and developmental problems.  Chronic medical problems Axis V: GAF  = 60  PLAN:   The parents are still concerned about the patient on Adderall as they believe that it is causing the patient to become irritable, although it has been noted that the patient has been less irritable in July when the medication was discontinued and school ended.  Will therefore discontinue Adderall. Will start Vyvanse, 20 mg qam for ADHD.  Will assess if Vyvanse can maintain the patient\u2019s attention span while also not inducing mood lability. Return to clinic in 2 weeks for follow up."

However, they do notice that the Vyvanse wears off at approximately 6:00 pm each evening.  Also the patient continues to have problems with sleep and the parents at times have to sleep with the patient in order for her to sleep throughout the night.  Melatonin is helping partially to help her to sleep.  Today we went over strategies to help contain the patient\u2019s behaviors.  Also, I provided psycho education regarding the patient\u2019s future treatment plan as this is the patient\u2019s last visit with me as she is currently stable.

If the patient has worsening sleep problems in the future, then consider switching to Clonidine, starting at 0.05 mg qhs and titrating up to 0.2 mg qhs for insomnia.  Clonidine in the evening may also help with some of the behavioural difficulties when Vyvanse is wearing off. As the patient is currently stable, I have not scheduled another appointment.

CURRENT MEDICATION:    Vyvanse 20 mg qam.  Melatonin, 6 mg qhs.  The patient is a nearly 7 year old female with history of ADHD and global developmental delay.  The patient continues to do well on Vyvanse.  On the teacher\u2019s ADHD rating scale, the teacher reported that the patient does not have many problems with ADHD symptoms.  In fact, she is able to pay more attention to her school work and is more organized.  Also, the parents have noticed that the patient has less distractibility, is more compliant with commands, and is also more organized.  The only side effect is that the patient has appetite suppression during lunch time.  Today we went over the meal plan as it is important for patient to get 3 meals per day with snacks.  Also, the patient continues to have sleep problems which appears to be associated with physical activity in the evening hours.  When mother cut out the physical activity at night and substituted it with soothing activities such as reading, the patient\u2019s sleep patterns have improved.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:    The patient is a 7 \u00bd year old male who lives with his mother in .  He is currently in Grade 2.  REASON FOR REFERRAL:    Mother is concerned that the patient is hearing voices when he is taking stimulant medication.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:     The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .  The patient has classic symptoms of ADHD characterized by distractibility, difficulty following directions, impulsivity and difficulty sitting still.  The patient was started on Biphentin, which has been titrated to 20 mg qam and 10 mg q2 pm.  There has been clear response at the school as patient is focusing better and doing well there, both academically and behaviorally.  However, the patient continues to have problems at home.  At home, the patient continues to have anger outbursts and becomes aggressive with his mother in which he would grab, pinch and shove his mother.  He has as low frustration tolerance and has difficulty with limit setting.  Again, these behaviors are mainly in the home setting as mother reports that he is doing well at school and does not get in trouble at school since starting Biphentin.  The patient reports he has been hearing voices over the past couple of months.  He states these voices come from inside of his head and these voices call his name.  He states these voices are familiar voices, they are either his mother or father\u2019s voices calling his name.   He denies any frank delusions.  He denies any other perceptual disturbances.  Mother is concerned that these voices are secondary to either the medication or to another diagnosis and therefore wanted to be sure with an assessment from a psychiatrist.  Mother states that at times the patient does have tearful episodes, however when the patient was questioned, he denies any low moods.  At times, the patient has difficulty going to sleep as he hears these \u201cvoices\u201d however he reports adequate energy level during the day.  He denies ever having any suicidal ideations and denies having any thoughts of self harm.  There have been multiple stressors including recent moves, and mother being on disability leave secondary to a failed relationship.  Patient denies any generalized worries, he denies any social phobia.  He denies any separation anxiety from his mother.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:    No prior psychiatric history.  This is his first psychiatric assessment. He has never had any counseling.  He  has been diagnosed with ADHD by  who started patient on Biphentin.  He has been on Biphentin for the past two months which has had clear benefit at school.   The patient was referred by  to the Family Help Program a couple of months ago.  Mother has been utilizing the program and states that this has been helpful although the patient continues to exhibit disruptive behaviors.  She can see that this may be helpful eventually to help contain his behaviors as this is a new approach and different from how she has been dealing with the patient\u2019s behaviors.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Asthma.  History of ear infections.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Biphentin, 20 mg qam, 10 mg q2pm.   Alvesco inhaler.  ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.  FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has a history of depression and possible ADHD.  Mother was adopted so is unaware of family history.  Biological father has a history of anger issues according to mother.  Paternal grandfather has a history of schizophrenia.  SOCIAL HISTORY:    The patient lives with his biological mother in .  He sees his biological father Mark on weekends.  They have joint custody.   Mother reports that besides her father living in , there are no other family supports.  Mother had a relationship a couple of years ago, however, mother was heartbroken when her partner left her abruptly and this led to her going on disability.  Mother states that the patient had witnessed her crying frequently, and to this day still has tearful episodes when thinking about her partner that left her without breaking it off officially.  Mother is currently employed in a call centre.  MENTAL STATUS EXAM:     The patient was cooperative and pleasant during the interview.  He did not exhibit any disruptive behaviors.  No hyper kinetic behavior noted.  His gait was grossly normal. No abnormal body movement noted.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  His affect was euthymic.  Mood was stable.  Thought form was concrete.  No loosening of association noted.   No flight of ideas noted.  Thought content, he denied suicidal ideations.  Not signs or symptoms of overt psychosis noted.  No frank delusions noted.  IMPRESSION:     7 \u00bd year old male who has a history and presentation consistent with ADHD.  The patient does not meet criteria for a psychotic disorder and does not meet any other psychiatric disorder co morbid with ADHD.  It is unlikely that Biphentin is causing these \u201cvoices\u201d as patient would had other associated symptoms of psychosis that would also be observable at school.  It appears that the patient\u2019s disruptive behaviors occur mainly at home and this may take some time to contain at home as mother just recently started with a parenting program with the .   I explained to mother that sometimes instituting a new behavioral approach may make the behaviors worse initially before they get better.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined type, by history Axis II:   None known Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   Primary support Axis V: GAF = 60  PLAN:   As the patient does not have another psychiatric co-morbidity, psychiatric follow-up is not needed at this time. The patient will follow up with  for treatment of ADHD. The mother will continue with the  to help to institute the behavioural plan at home to help contain patient\u2019s behaviours.  I explained to mother that this may take time for his behaviours to shift while she is learning new techniques to contain the patient\u2019s behaviours at home. At this time I do not plan to see the patient again unless he has other problems in the future."

He had a trial of Ritalin and then was titrated to tid dosing and he apparently did well at school.  The evenings were much worse though when the Ritalin wore off.   The patient was eventually switched to Biphentin which had significant effect on his ability to focus and it decreased his impulsivity.  However, the patient eventually became more hyperactive and he was switched to Adderall XR.  However, this made the patient angrier and he was then switched to Dexedrine Spansules.

  "content": "Psychiatric Evaluation  DOB : 09/07/1998 Date of evaluation: May 11, 2011  The patient was seen with his grandmother for a psychiatric evaluation.  IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:   The patient is a 12 year old male who lives with his grandmother in .  He currently is in Grade 7.   REASON FOR REFERRAL:   Problems with anxiety  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .  The patient was admitted to the Pediatric Unit at the  by  in February, 2011 secondary to anorexia, school refusal, poor sleep habits, and GI issues.  In the hospital, the patient was assessed by , psychiatrist, who opined that the patient\u2019s decreased energy and reluctance to get out of bed was likely secondary to anxiety.   also opined that the patient should not take stimulant medication any longer, as they were having mixed benefits in the past and may have been adding to his low appetite and growth problems.  He was subsequently prescribed Fluoxetine, 5 mg daily and titrated to 10 mg daily recently.  However, Fluoxetine was never really started by his grandmother as patient was having difficulty swallowing the capsules and liquid formulation, and preferred to have a tablet.  While in the hospital he started to eat ham and cheese sandwiches.  Prior to the hospitalization, the patient had significant problems.  He had refused to go to school for a couple of weeks and did not seem to enjoy school.   The patient also had significant initial insomnia and was up for hours before falling asleep.  He was difficult to wake in the morning and he did not eat much during the day.  When he did eat solid foods, he would end up with diarrhea.  When he did go to school, he had difficulty performing and had difficulty completing his school work.  The patient had been exposed to multiple stressors over the past several years.  Until March, 2011, the patient and his maternal grandmother were living with many people under one roof, including patient\u2019s aunt Shelly, patient\u2019s 5 year old cousin Jenna, and patient\u2019s maternal grandfather.  The patient has always been under the care of the maternal grandmother since birth as the patient\u2019s mother was not able to care for the parent and patient\u2019s parents separated a few months after patient was born.  Up until March, 2011, the patient had significant stressors at home.  The patient felt he was left out at home as much attention was spent on his 5 year old cousin Jenna.  His grandfather ignored patient and only paid attention to Jenna.  Patient had significant feelings of rejection.  Another stressor was that patient was at a school that patient did not really like.  Apparently his classroom was very disruptive and was not a pleasant environment for the patient.  Another complication may have been patient\u2019s stimulant medications that he had been taken for a number of years, since Grade 2 when he was diagnosed with ADHD.  There had been concerns that patient\u2019s poor appetite and problems with sleep may have been secondary to treatment with stimulants.  In Grade Primary to Grade 6, patient has had difficulties focusing and staying on task.  Patient had significant adjustment problems going from Grade 6 to Junior High.   He is very attached to his grandmother.  He doesn\u2019t ride the school bus as he is nervous to walk to bus stop so therefore gets dropped off by his grandmother every day to school.  Also, the patient has difficulty sleeping alone so therefore still sleeps with his grandmother.  Last year, grandmother thought the patient was depressed as he did not get out of bed and had decreased appetite.  Last fall, patient found school very stressful.  Patient has also had multiple somatic complaints including complaints of muscle pain and stiffness, and also diarrhea when eating.     In March, 2011, grandmother decided to sell the house and to move to another place so that the patient could have more attention and more peace and quiet at home.  The grandmother eventually found a house for them to live with just the two of them and patient found a new school to attend.   He started at  and appears to be enjoying it.  Since the move to a new house and starting a new school, the patient seemed to improve.  His appetite and intake increased and he went from a low of 61 lbs in February, 2001 to a weight of approximately 71 lbs.  Grandmother stated that he gained 8 lbs since February, 2011.  Also, grandmother opined that patient appeared less depressed and also appeared less stressed and this improvement occurred without the help of Fluoxetine which grandmother just discontinued secondary to patient\u2019s problems with swallowing capsules and liquids.  Grandmother also believed that patient\u2019s appetite and anxiety improved as he was discontinued from stimulants when he was hospitalized in February.  At the new school, patient has been attending every day, but he is still having academic problems as he is having difficulty in his coursework.  According to grandmother, the school is not following the IPP that was devised at the old school.  Patient currently receives no extra help with his difficult subjects.  Nonetheless, he is making friends at his new school and appears to be more comfortable there.  Also, his  new home with his grandmother appears to be to his liking.  He continues to have problems with initial insomnia and continues to sleep in his grandmother\u2019s bed.  He states he will be harmed by supernatural forces if he sleeps by himself and feels better if his grandmother is there to protect him.  Grandmother states she has never had a babysitter for him as she could never leave him as he had significant separation anxiety from her.  Patient denies any social anxiety symptoms; he denies any fears of crowds and denies any social scrutiny.  He denies any generalized worries.

He also is not exhibiting any mood or anxiety symptoms that he had when he was living at his old house and at the old school.  The anxiety symptoms have attenuated over the last several weeks, however there seems to be some school problems as the school isn\u2019t following the IPP.

ADHD by history Axis II:  Deferred  Axis III:  Consider stimulant induced anorexia Axis IV:   Primary support Axis V: GAF   = 60  PLAN:  No medications indicated at this time as patient currently does not meet criteria for an anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. I advised the grandmother to have a meeting with the school so they can reinstitute the IPP and get patient extra help in tutoring in his difficult subjects.

They include patient\u2019s attachment to his grandmother, continuing sleep problems and patient sleeping with grandmother, and his eating problems as he continues to be very picky.  I will refer patient and his grandmother to Dr. Marc Blumberg for individual and family therapy. I do not plan on seeing patient again as there is no evidence of an anxiety disorder or mood disorder.  However if patient develops worsening anxiety or depressive symptoms in the future, consider re-referring to my clinic."

Mother is not able to place patient with a babysitter or in daycare as he is too disruptive and hyperactive.  She states that only she can contain his behaviors and she is currently at her wits\u2019 end as she is virtually running with him all day to contain his behaviors and meltdowns.  Mother has tried numerous parent management techniques such as 1-2-3 Magic to help contain behaviors but this has not been effective.  Given the severity of patient\u2019s symptoms and due to the fact that mother is not able to contain these behaviors and has no supports, we will consider medication treatments at this time.  I do realize that the patient is quite young to receive medication treatment for ADHD; however, at this time, given the severity of ADHD symptoms and that his mother is not able to contain the behavior any longer, we have to consider medication treatment at this time.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:    Consider Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.   Rule out learning disability.  Consider parent/child relationship conflict Axis II:   Deferred Axis III:   Asthma Axis IV:   No contact with his biological father.  Single mom household.  Lack of family supports. Axis V: GAF 50  PLAN:   Will start Methylphenidate 5 mg q am and q noon for ADHD symptoms. Return to clinic in one week for immediate follow up. Consider referring for patient and mother for behavioural counselling with a psychologist."

The patient exhibits significant depressive symptoms to the point where he has marked psychomotor retardation.  He also has significant mood lability.  He denies any history of flashbacks and denies any history of nightmares.  The patient became very irritable when I told him I could not fill out his psychiatric disability form as it required a comprehensive evaluation looking at his home functioning and activities of daily living.

I told him I needed more information and the purpose of this interview was for a medication consult, not a disability consult.  IMPRESSION:   47 year old male with a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of severe depression.  At this time, the patient does not meet the criteria for PTSD, although he appears to be traumatized by what happened to him while he was still working.

I would recommend that  make a referral to mental health services at Veterans Affairs as soon as possible. At this time, the patient denies any suicidal ideations.  However, he continues to have significant depressive symptoms.  I would recommend that the patient be referred to a therapist for counselling, while he is waiting for mental health services at Veterans Affairs. I did not schedule another appointment with the patient as his needs are too complex for private practice, and he needs to be treated by a multi-disciplinary mental health team.

There was significant difference in his ability to focus and get his school work done.  However, in April the patient had an increase in mood lability and disruptive behaviors.  Mother was quick to blame the medication again and therefore this was discontinued despite the patient doing so well at school and being able to focus.  The patient has a private therapist.

Today I went over strategies with the parents to help them monitor the patient\u2019s symptoms and to help him to not engage in behaviors that continue to make him depressed.   IMPRESSION:   Major Depressive Disorder with co-morbid ADHD, inattentive type.  The patient continues to exhibit sustained depressive symptoms.  No acute safety issues noted.  PLAN:   Will start Zoloft 25 mg daily for one week, then increase to 50 mg daily for depressive symptoms. Will continue Vyvanse 30 mg qam for ADHD symptoms. Patient will continue individual therapy with his therapist. Return to clinic in three weeks for follow up."

CURRENT MEDICATION:      Vyvanse, 30 mg qam.  The patient is a 12 year old male with history of ADHD, inattentive type.   The patient reports worsening depressive symptoms since the family crisis.  The patient has exhibited low moods, irritability, low energy level, poor concentration, and poor appetite.  The patient has had thoughts of death but denies any suicidal ideation and denies any plan.    Today I had a discussion with the patient and his father that the patient is exhibiting sustained depressive symptoms, which may either be part of Major Depressive Disorder or part of adjustment reaction in response to the family stressor.  The father stated he would rather take a wait and see approach to assess if his symptoms improve with time or are sustained and worsen in the future.  IMPRESSION:   Consider Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood.  Rule out emerging Major Depressive Disorder.   ADHD inattentive type by history.  The patient has been exhibiting multiple depressive symptoms in response to the family stressor recently.  No acute safety issues noted.   PLAN:   No antidepressants indicated at this time.  However, if the patient exhibits worsening depressive symptoms in the future, then consider starting an SSRI such as Zoloft. Will continue Vyvanse 30 mg qam for ADHD symptoms. Patient will continue individual therapy with his therapist. I counselled the patient not to engage in depressive behaviours such as isolating himself and playing video games all day Return to clinic in two months for follow up."

CURRENT MEDICATION:      Vyvanse, 30 mg qam.  The patient is a 12 year old male with history of ADHD, inattentive type.   The patient refused to come to the appointment today as he was frustrated and stated that he did not want to be forced to take any treatments.  Significant developments have happened in the family.  The family was initially going to move to  but the move was cancelled as the father did not get the job he was expecting there.  This apparently was a big letdown for the patient as he was all set to move.  Also, in the family, another development happened in which the father was charged with sexual assault and was arrested.  The father is an .  He was given an LOA with pay pending the investigation.  The family is devastated as now the father could possibly lose his job and/or spend time in jail for the charges.  This latest hit to the family has been quite stressful for the patient and mother is concerned he is becoming more depressed as he is quite sensitive, is withdrawing and is irritable.  There is a history of depression and anxiety in the family.  The patient continues to take his Vyvanse 30 mg qam.  Today I counseled the parents regarding how to help the patient during these stressful times.  I encouraged them not to discuss the charges and court case in front of the patient as this just makes him more anxious and worried.   I also counseled the parents to have the patient reengage with his therapist, and also that his continued treatment of Vyvanse is optional.  I told the parents to talk to the patient that him coming here and him taking medication is voluntary.  Should he decide not to take the medication it would be okay to go off of it as we would need to assess his baseline symptoms anyways.   PLAN:   The plan is to have the patient see me in 2-3 weeks for follow up and the patient is to reengage with his therapist here."

Today I explained to the patient that her primary problem is her pain symptoms and that her mental health problems were secondary to the pain problems at this time.  The patient was in agreement with that assessment as she can hardly function due to the pain.  The patient denied any thoughts of self harm.  IMPRESSION:      The patient continues to suffer from debilitating pain from Fibromyalgia.  It is my opinion has secondary problems of depression and anxiety due to the severe pain symptoms.  At this time, the patient\u2019s pain symptoms need to be addressed, preferably by the complex pain team.  Until the patient\u2019s pain symptoms are under control, her mental health problems will not be effectively addressed.  PLAN:   The patient will follow up with Dr. Gregoire to address the pain symptoms and be referred for speciality care from a pain team. At this time, I would not recommend any changes to her psychotropic medications with Zoloft and Ativan as the patient needs more adequate treatment for her pain symptoms. When the patient\u2019s pain symptoms are better under control, then the patient was instructed to return to my clinic so that I can adequately assess her psychiatric symptoms. The patient will continue individual therapy with her private therapist."

CURRENT MEDICATION:    Abilify 4 mg qhs.  The patient is a 15 year old female with history of ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  Since the last visit, both Risperdal and Strattera were tapered and discontinued.  However, mother called me several days ago as the patient was exhibiting worsening mood lability and anger outbursts.

The patient also continues to have menstrual problems as they had become irregular with Risperdal being initiated.  The patient continues to have impulsivity, distractibility and hyperactivity.  She denies any side effects to Abilify.  In fact she reports she has less sedation on Abilify than when on Risperdal.   Today I went over some strategies to help the parents contain the patient\u2019s behaviors.  IMPRESSION:   The patient had worsening mood lability and anger outbursts with the discontinuance of both Risperdal and Strattera.  The patient has tolerated the initiation of Abilify without side effects.  However, she continues to have significant ADHD symptoms.  PLAN:  Will start Vyvanse 20 mg qam for ADHD symptoms. Will increase Abilify to 5 mg qhs for extreme mood lability and anger outbursts. The patient will eventually need individual therapy to help her learn more appropriate coping skills.  Consider getting laboratories including prolactin level at the next visit as the patient most likely has disrupted menstrual cycles due to hyper prolactinemia from Risperdal treatment.  I suspect that this should improve now that Risperdal has been discontinued. Return to clinic in one month for follow up."

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  The patient is a nearly 7 year old male who will be attending Grade 1.  He lives with his adoptive parents and 14 year old adopted sibling in .  REASON FOR REFERRAL:    Worsening aggression and disruptive behaviors.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by .  The patient was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and is followed by  for ADHD.  The patient was adopted at the age of 18 months.  The birth mother was apparently homeless and lived on the streets and also had a history of drug abuse.  The patient apparently had no prenatal care.  The patient was apprehended by Child Protection and was placed in foster care.  In his foster home, there was limited contact and limited affection.  He has a history of language delay and gross motor deficits.  However, he has now caught up.  As a toddler, he was hyperactive.  Over the last six months, patient has become more aggressive with his mother and other kids in the home.  He hits, pushes, and also is verbally abusive.  He also engages in property destruction.  He exhibits daily mood lability and is quite belligerent.  He has a history of running away from school and is s flight risk, and therefore the patient requires a one to one to be with him full time.   The patient is quite oppositional and defiant.  He engages in animal cruelty and the parents have to watch him around animals.  He reports having difficulty getting to sleep.  He denies any thoughts of self harm.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:   The patient has never been seen by mental health.  He was diagnosed with FASD by  at age 4.  The patient was subsequently diagnosed with ADHD by .  The patient had previous trials of multiple stimulants.  A trial of Adderall led to more mood swings and on Concerta, the patient became more hyperactive.  A trial of Vyvanse led to irritability.  The patient is currently on Biphentin and Ritalin.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Eczema and asthma.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Biphentin, 15 mg qam and Ritalin 5 mg qpm.  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  FAMILY HISTORY:   The biological mother had mental health issues and apparently was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility.  The biological is unidentified.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was adopted at 18 months old.  He was apprehended at birth by Child Protection and placed into foster care in which he had little contact or affection with patient.  The patient requires continuous supervision both at home and at school.  There are extended family members involved including an aunt and maternal grandparents for support. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:    An almost 7 year old male.  He was cooperative during the interview.  He had difficulty focusing and was quite fidgety.  He also was quite distractible.  His speech exhibited normal patterns.  His affect was euthymic.  Mood stable.   Thought form was organized and concrete.  Thought content, the patient denied any suicidal ideations.  He did report some anxiety about needles.  He reports he likes having friends.  The patient does report an interest in roller coasters, storms and hurricanes; however he denies any compulsions and does not exhibit any ritualistic behaviors.  IMPRESSION:   The patient is a nearly 7 year old male with a history of ADHD complicated by FAS.  At this point, it is unclear if the patient is exhibiting ODD as his aggressive behaviors have only been present for the past few months.  There are no underlying anxiety disorders or depression contributing to the patient\u2019s aggression.  The patient\u2018s aggressive behaviors may be complicated by the fact that he has severe ADHD and FAS.  Patients with this profile do not respond as well to stimulant treatment.  May need to address the ADHD with alternative treatment such as tricyclic antidepressants if the ADHD symptoms worsen on therapeutic doses of stimulant treatment.  DIAGNOSIS:  Axis I:   ADHD and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder by history.  Rule out Oppositional Defiant Disorder.  Rule out Adjustment Disorder. Axis II:   None known. Axis III:  Non-contributory Axis IV:   Early childhood neglect and abuse Axis V: GAF  = 55  PLAN:   Will increase Biphentin to 20 mg qam for ADHD symptoms.   Consider adding Risperdal if impulsive aggression continues. Will continue Ritalin 5 mg qpm for late afternoon coverage of ADHD symptoms. Will send an ADHD rating scale to patient\u2019s teacher after patient is back in school for one month. If the patient continues to exhibit disruptive behaviours and severe ADHD symptoms and is not responding to stimulant treatment, then consider switching patient to tricyclic antidepressant treatment.

The patient continues to respond to higher dosages of Biphentin.  Biphentin however only lasts for 4-5 hours and then his ADHD symptoms worsen.  I received the ADHD rating scales from his teacher.  The teacher states that during the morning hours, the patient is able to focus and doesn\u2019t have any distractibility.  However, by the afternoon hours, beginning at 11 am or Noon, he starts to have distractibility and poor attention span.  Today I had a long discussion with the parents regarding the behavioral plan.  The parents are having difficulty with having the school institute a consistent EPA as there are no resources to institute only one EPA.  Also, the parents are concerned that the school is not consistently delivering the structured behavioral plan at school.  Today I went over strategies to help the parents advocate for more services for the patient and also had discussions on how to contain his behaviors, both at home and at school.

  "content": "Psychiatric Clinic Note  DOB : 12/09/2004 Date of evaluation: October 1, 2011  The patient was seen with his parents for a follow up visit to psychiatry clinic.  CURRENT MEDICATION:    Biphentin, 20 mg qam.   Ritalin 5 mg qpm. Melatonin 3 mg qhs.  The patient is a 7 year old male with history of ADHD and FAS.  The patient has responded partially to the higher dosage of Biphentin.  During the morning hours, the patient is able to focus better and is less distractible.  However, during the afternoon hours, the patient has worsening distractibility and worsening attention span.  The mother said the Biphentin only lasts until 11:00 am or Noon.  The mother continues to require that the patient get Ritalin 5 mg when he gets home as he is too distractible and hyperactive during the late afternoon hours.  The patient is also experiencing appetite suppression at lunch time but eventually catches up during dinner time.  The patient does continue to have low frustration tolerance and irritability; however he has not had any anger outbursts recently.  The patient appears to do better when he has a one to one.  He apparently has an EPA during the morning hours, but does not have one in the afternoon hours.  This shows in his ability to focus and his disruptive behaviors as they are worse during the afternoon hours which cannot be explained by the stimulant medication wearing off at that time.  There appears to be a correlation between an EPA and the patient\u2019s ability to focus on school.  Certainly the Biphentin may not be lasting all day and may need to consider divided dosing of Biphentin if he does not respond to higher dosages.  IMPRESSION:   The patient continues to have worsening ADHD symptoms during the afternoon hours.  However, there are environment factors which need to be addressed before major changes to his ADHD medications are made.  For instance, the patient is currently in a class with over 25 kids and also only receives EPA during the morning hours.  PLAN:   Will increase Biphentin to 30 mg qam for ADHD.  If the higher dosage of Biphentin does not cover the afternoon hours, and if the duration of action only lasts until 11:00 am or Noon, then consider adding another dose of Biphentin at Noon. Will continue Ritalin 5 mg qpm for late afternoon coverage of ADHD symptoms. The patient will continued on Melatonin 3mg qhs for insomnia. I wrote a letter to the school outlining the patient\u2019s needs as the patient has problems with distractibility and poor focus.  He does well with an EPA and I advocated that the patient gets an EPA for all day in school, and also that he receives resource for his most difficult subjects.  I also advocated that the patient be placed in a smaller classroom setting with less than a dozen kids as his ADHD symptoms need to be accommodated. Return to clinic in one month for follow up."

  "content": "Psychiatric Follow Up  DOB : 24/04/1993 Date of clinic visit: July 22, 2011 The patient was seen with girlfriend for a psychiatric follow up visit.  CURRENT MEDICATION:     Zoloft 50 mg daily.  The patient is an 18 year old male with history of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and cannabis abuse.  The patient reports that Zoloft has thus far had no effect on his anxiety symptoms.  However, he states he has had a significant side effect while on Zoloft.  He reports that he now has erectile dysfunction and can no longer ejaculate.  He states that this is a major factor as he no longer wants to continue taking Zoloft.  IMPRESSION:   The patient continues to have significant anxiety symptoms, however he continues to abuse cannabis.  He is experiencing sexual dysfunction on Zoloft.    PLAN:  Will start Ginkgo Biloba 60 mg po tid for sexual dysfunction associated with SSRI\u2019s. Will continue Zoloft 50 mg daily for anxiety symptoms. Benzodiazepines are contraindicated in this patient as he continues to abuse cannabis.  I explained to patient that his continued abuse of cannabis will only be a barrier for his anxiety treatment as cannabis use over the long term could actually worsen his emotional state. The patient continues to refuse individual therapy. If Zoloft is not helpful for his anxiety symptoms in the future, then consider switching to Buspirone which is indicated for generalized anxiety disorder and is non-addictive. Return to clinic in one month for follow up."
