  "content": "N. is a 19 year old single caucasian female, who is attending university and works part-time as a cashier for a pizza restaurant. She has a history of recurrent depressive episodes, which starts in the late fall/early winter months, and remits during the spring. She uses light therapy every morning for 30 minutes, as without it, she would be unable to function. Although her family doctor has recommended that she consider antidepressant medication treatment, N. has adamantly refused, stating that it is unnatural, as she tries to ingest healthy and natural foods. When she becomes depressed, she has symptoms of low moods, anhedonia, excessive fatigue, excessive sleep, increased appetite, carbohydrate cravings, and weight gain.Her family history is significant for her mother suffering from bipolar disorder, and who dies in a car accident when N. was only 12 years old. It is highly suspected that the car accident was a suicide. N. has refused to see a therapist, stating she does not need psychological help, and that she can deal with her mother\u2019s death on her own. After the death of her mother, she and her brother were sent to live with their estranged father and step-mother, and their infant daughter, N.\u2019s half-sister. She is the oldest of 3 siblings. Suffice it to say, N. did not get along well with her father and step-mother, and was jealous of all the attention her infant sister got from the family. When N. became depressed in the winter months, she locked herself in her room, and would sleep constantly, not contributing to the chores the family needed. When she was not sleeping, she would leave and spend days with her friends, without any check-ins with her parents.Eventually,she ran away from home after her graduation from high school, and was not found until her father shamed her on Facebook that his daughter was missing and is now a runaway. Humiliated, N. contacted her father and assured him she was safe.She eventually enrolled in university, and only has cursory contact with her father and siblings. Her first year in university was difficult, and she almost failed her classes due to sleeping too much when her depression would worsen like clockwork in the fall and winter.When spring would come around, she would have increased energy and could work for 12 hours a day and go out with her friends at night with only minimal sleep. She spends her summer doing lots of outdoor activities, as she likes to soak in the sun, and dreads each day after June 21st, when the sun exposure would decrease little by little with each passing day. Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder, recurrent, in partial remission, with seasonal pattern. Rule-out bipolar disorder, given the history of hypomanic symptoms, and family history of bipolar disorder. The patient had only a partial response to the current dose of light therapy.Treatment: 1) Will increase light therapy duration to 60 minutes every morning, from a 10,000 lux light box. Will need to monitor for any signs of mania, as light therapy may switch someone with an underlying bipolar disorder from depression to mania.2) If no response in 1 to 2 weeks, then consider augmenting light therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).3) Recommend other helpful strategies for depression, including exercise, meditation, yoga, and outdoor time to increase sunlight exposure.4) Treatment with antidepressant medications is a relative contraindication, as bipolar disorder has not been ruled out.5) Return to clinic in 2 weeks for follow-up.",

There have been concerns that patient may have psychotic symptoms.  However, patient has intact reality testing.   is a gifted child intellectually, and many appear to be bizarre as he thinks differently from other kids his age.  's needs a behavioral plan, which takes into account his superior intellectual functioning.  On the other hand, mother reports patient as being immature, emotionally and socially.  This also needs to be incorporated within the behavioral plan.  Provisional diagnosis: Axis I: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, oppositional defiant disorder. : none known I: noncontributory. : problems at school, parental conflict : GAF 40.  Initial treatment plan: Will start methylphenidate 5 mg now as a test dose.

  "content": " Cottreau Date of Birth: November 17, 1996 Date of Evaluation: September 26, 2006  Psychiatric Evaluation   Identifying Information: 8 year-old male who lives in South Ohio, Yarmouth County, NS with his biological mother, .  He is the 3rd of 5 siblings, and is in the 3rd grade.  Reason for referral: rule-out bipolar disorder and 2nd opinion regarding treatment services/placement.   of Present Illness:   was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. .   has been seen by Dr. Chandler for the last few years.  He has exhibited disruptive behaviors for several years, but has escalated this year.   had been raised by his foster mother, , since infancy.   apparently agreed to care for patient when he was an infant, as  was a friend of a friend of the biological mother, , who was not capable of raising patient at the time.   has recently been sent back to live with , as  has not been able to control patient\u2019s behaviors lately.   has a history of property destruction, vandalism, and assaultive behaviors.  He has also lit fires and has a history of aggression towards animals.  He also lies and steals, and has a history of sexualized behaviors.  He is especially irritable and explosive when limits are set, and has a low frustration tolerance.  Other symptoms include difficulty sitting still, impulsivity, disorganization, and always forgets things.   has normal sleep patterns, and a good appetite.  \u2019s irritability usually does not last for more than half the day, and usually occrs in the context of limit-setting and not getting what he wants.   has mentioned suicidal ideations in the past, but within the context of patient becoming angry after limits were set and he did not get his way.   and  have not been concerned about patient hurting himself, but have been concerned about patient hurting others when he becomes aggressive.  Behaviors have worsened since \u2019s boyfriend moved-in in May 2005.  There is apparently much chaos and lack of structure/consistency between the 2 households where patient lives.   apparently requests to live at the other mother\u2019s house when he gets into trouble at one household.     Psychiatric :   has exhibited disruptive behaviors since early childhood.  The 1st grade teacher suggested that patient be referred to mental health, as he was already disruptive.  He was subsequently referred to a therapist 3 years ago for temper tantrums and not listening.   was educated on 123 Magic, which was somewhat helpful.  Dropped out after only 3 session.  Last year, patient saw a therapist about 6 times, before dropping out of treatment again.   has been followed by Dr. .  He has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and , with bipolar disorder remaining on the differential.   has a trial of Adderall, but this was discontinued, as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms were the least severe symptoms, as patient was exhibiting extreme mood lability and assaultive behaviors, for which  was started.   to date has been minimally effective at decreasing the irritability and disruptive behaviors.   Medical : no acute medical problems  Current Medications:  0.5mg BID  Family : Father has bipolar disorder.  Brief Psychosocial  It was reported that  has spent time in both \u2019s (biological mom) and \u2019s homes growing up.   and  reported that when  was 1 week old,  was having a difficult time post-pregnancy with  (\u2018I would feed him and that\u2019s it\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t really interact with him\u2019).  At this time, both reported that  became involved to help  out.  From there it was reported that  continued to be involved in \u2019s care.  It was reported that throughout the years, custody has gone back and forth between  and .  Most recently, it was reported that  has custody.    When asked about living arrangements,  reported the following.  At \u2019s there is  (\u2019s boyfriend), Kyle (\u2019s son), Tyler (\u2019s other son), and .   reported not getting along with Kyle or Tyler (\u2018We fight. I beat them up. They do things that bug me (e.g. touch his bike)\u2019).   did report getting along well with  and .  At \u2019s,  reported there is Marise (sister), Daniel (brother), Hubert (mom\u2019s boyfriend), and .   reported not getting along with Hubert (\u2018he\u2019s mean to me\u2019 \u2013 when asked how he is mean,  indicated he places limits on him and he does not like this).   did report getting along with .   reported despite not getting along with everyone in both settings, that he liked both homes.    Regarding living arrangements,  reported she feels  needs a structured environment where there is lots of consistency.   questioned whether this would be best found in a residential program.   reported she felt she has not always been consistent and that she has struggled with how to address s different behaviours.   reported she felt that  requires a home where he does not get what he wants all the time and where he learns to wait.   also questioned whether different medication was required.   and  reported they have not seen \u2018eye to eye\u2019 on how to parent  through the years, but that they have been trying more recently to present a collaborative front.  Both  and  are looking for strategies to help with caring for .  With regards to school and socialization with peers,  currently attends grade 3 at South Centennial School.  He reported liking school for the most part with his favorite subject being French.  He indicated he finds school hard and that last year this led him to avoid attending at times (e.g. refusing to go, getting in trouble to be sent home, etc.).   reported that as far as peers went he had friends both at school and home.  He reported he enjoys spending time with friends and indicated they do things like bike, skateboard, and play soccer together.   indicated he and his friends do get in fights at times but that they talk and things usually work themselves out.   and  reported no socialization concerns.  Mental Status Exam  presented to session today wearing jeans and a t-shirt and appearing his stated age.  Upon entering the assessment room,  immediately began going through toy boxes and bins.   was noted to be quite fidgety, moving around the room a lot and switching quickly between activities.   actively engaged in appropriate play with both  and  during this time, using toys appropriately.   when asked questions answered jokingly with wrong answers (e.g. what grade are you in? What school are you at?).   had a difficult time initially talking to clinicians without  or  present (\u2018I don\u2019t want to without them\u2019).  After a break,  did talk with a clinician alone.   had some difficulty paying attention to questions asked, requiring some repeating.  His insight into concerns was noted to be minimal \u2013 indicated he has no concerns and did not know why  and  had brought him in today.  With some more questions  was able to indicate he would like to not get so mad and would like to be able to talk to his moms ( and ) more when he has a problem.  \u2019s thought content and process appeared age appropriate.  There was no evidence of perceptual disturbances or safety concerns.  Impression: 8 year-old male who has a history and presentation consistent with a diagnosis of  and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  At this time, patient does not meet criteria for bipolar disorder.   continues to exhibit disruptive behaviors in the context of multiple caretakers and lack of structure and consistency in those households.  Diagnosis: Axis I:  \tAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Axis II: none known : No diagnosis : primary supports, school, peers Axis V: GAF 45  Recommendations:  would benefit from in-home community treatment based on the Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST) model, as this is an evidence-based treatment for youth with conduct disorder.  The focus of community treatment would be to institute structure and consistency across all community settings, including the households and the school.  Should these community interventions ultimately fail, then consider referring patient to a residential treatment center.      , MD\t\t\tKathryn Joudrey   Cc: \t, CAS \tDr.  ",

With regards to diagnosis, given the history \u2019s parents provided of delayed and and qualatative impairement in language, qualitative impairement in social interaction, and some restricted patteren of behaviour and interests it would seem the most likely diagnosis would be a pervasive developmental disorder such as autism.  The history the family provided did not seem to be consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  I would speculate that  has moderate mental retardation.  Such assessments regarding developmental disorder needs to be referred to appropriate subspecialty services.  If the family is interested, I would be happy to put a referral for  to the IWK Autism Clinic.  At the clinic, specific measures such as the ADOS can be provided to help confirm the diagnosis.  The family was not interested at our initial meeting, but I would be happy to help in the future.  I think that neuropsychological testing, as per your suggestion, is an excellent idea as it will provide an important baseline and will help monitor \u2019s progression cognitively whether or not he receives active treatement.  At the time of the intial consult, \u2019s parents did not feel his his behaviours were problematic enough to warrant medication.  That being said, should  be a candidate for surgery, please do not hesitate to contact our consultaion liason service.

He was incoherent and did not have capacity to make decisions for himself.  When speaking with his parents during the hospitalization, they stated that his problems began approximately the end of 2006, where he was observed to be extremely disorganized and extremely labile.  Also while he was in school, teachers noticed that  refused to work on the computer because \u201cthe little men on the computer were trying to f--- with him\u201d.    Certainly towards the end of 2006,  appeared to exhibit what looks like a worsening psychotic episode.  However, prior to this time it is difficult to ascertain if \u2019s behaviours were influenced by psychotic symptoms.  It is my opinion that the incident that occurred on October 5, 2006 was most likely influenced by psychotic illness, as patients with acute psychosis often do not know what is right or wrong as they are not based in reality.  However, it is uncertain whether  exhibited psychotic symptoms before 2006.    If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me at (902) 470-6570.

When asked about her mood over the last week,  reported that it was 2.5 out of 10 (where 10=happiest).    identified January 2008 as when her mood was the lowest. When asked what was happening at that time,  reported that her aunt had a stroke in December with many complications in hospital and that  was very busy and stressful.  She reported that returning to school in January exacerbated her mood as she had to write exams and was growing increasingly worried about her applications to university.  noted that she sets high expectations for herself in school and that this makes her \u201cuptight\u201d.  described her low mood as lasting most of the day, nearly every day. She reported feeling worthless, empty at times, and noted that she felt guilty about the team taking time to do an assessment of her. She noted that she does not want to get out of bed in the morning and cries a lot when alone but is \u201cpretty good at smiling through it\u201d in front of other people. She described herself as having low motivation, fatigue, and psychomotor retardation when feeling down. She noted decreases in her attention and concentration levels since September 2007 and felt this may have occurred as early as January 2007; consequently, while her marks remain in the 80s and 90s, she noted that they have slipped a little this school year.  reported diminished pleasure in previously enjoyed activities including sewing and crafts. She noted that she stopped participating in sports in June 2007 but has recently joined a rugby team.    denied having any current suicidal plans but admitted thinking about death. She identified grade 8 as the first time that she thought about death with a noted increase in her preoccupation over  2007.  said in January 2008 that \u201call the time it felt it would be so nice to die\u201d. Currently, there has been a decrease in the constancy of these thoughts of death. She denied any previous suicide attempt but admitted to cutting herself to release her anxiety, pain, and sadness. She reported that she \u201cscratched\u201d herself one week ago with a razor. She noted that cutting helps release her emotions for a little while and denied any associated guilt. She noted that she might cut more if she was an impulsive person but that in general, her cutting has a ritual around it that takes time.   endorsed both initial and middle insomnia as well as difficulty waking up in the morning. She noted that because she has trouble concentrating, it takes her a long time to complete her homework, thus delaying her sleep onset. When asked what would happen if she was asked to leave the assignment unfinished, she reported that she would not be able to sleep because she would keep thinking about it.   In terms of anxiety,  described herself as having always been a \u201cworrier\u201d but that the worry has increased since January 2007.  reported anxiety around her university applications, her future, her mother\u2019s wellbeing and safety, being home alone at night, and other \u201csmall things\u201d including some minor checking behaviour of doors and the stove. When she is away from her house (e.g., at school), she says that she worries constantly about something happening at her house and what that would mean for her mother. When she is worried, she becomes fidgety, restless, has difficulty concentrating, and noted that worrying keeps her up at night. She also indicated that she has trouble controlling her worry.  also endorsed a number of symptoms of social anxiety including avoidance of social situations (e.g., going to the mall or to the movies, doing an oral presentation). When she cannot avoid a feared situation, she described her anxiety as constant while she is in the situation. For example, if she were to have to be out with a group of people, she reported she might visit the washroom ten times so that she could be alone and cope with her anxiety. This social anxiety appears to have been present since the summer of 2007. When she is worrying about things, these thoughts frequently turn negative which then lowers her mood (e.g., what if I don\u2019t get into university, then I won\u2019t get a job, what am I going to do for the rest of my life, etc.).    noted that she does not like to eat in front of people and has fears about gaining weight.  According to  and her mother, she has lost between 20 and 30 pounds since October/November 2007.  reported that she wants to lose weight and that she currently feels she is obese. She noted, \u201cobese people don\u2019t get married\u201d. She described checking the calories of food and that she restricts her food intake. On a typical day, she reported eating one snack and one meal (generally her supper when she tries to fill up with vegetables). She reported that she is not hungry most of the time and before experiencing low moods, she ate regularly. She indicated that she went through a period of during which she purged daily and used laxatives. Currently, she reports no purging and has increased her eating restrictions to compensate. She did not endorse any binging behaviour or weight checking. Prior to spring of 2007, she reported that her menses were regular but has only had approximately three to four periods since that time with the last one in December 2007.  \u2019s mother reported that she saw sadness as the major issue with an onset in grade 8 and a worsening in the past year. She described her daughter as quieter, less bubbly, and tearful when she is feeling down. Her mother has noticed that  has cut back on her food intake and that she has lost weight but did not admit to being concerned.  She noted that when  eats, she makes healthy choices. \u2019s mother noted that  seemed to go to bed at a reasonable hour but was not sure exactly when  falls asleep. She reported that while  has frequently described herself as being tired, she does not seem unduly tired to her mother. \u2019s mother reported being \u201camazed at how well  functions\u201d but that she knows her daughter has \u201cincredible sadness\u201d. Initially when speaking to \u2019s mother, it was difficult to ascertain whether she was worried about her daughter\u2019s mood and trying to remain optimistic or whether she was unconcerned. However, the former appears to be the case (for example, her mother became tearful when she was asked whether she had any concerns about \u2019s safety).   There was no evidence of mania.    PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: No history of psychiatric hospitalizations.  The patient was seen by mobile crisis and seen in the IWK ED for suicidal ideations in January 2008.   was started 3 weeks ago by the on-call psychiatrist in the IWK ED.  The patient has exhibited a partial response to fluoxetine, as she has less suicidal ideations and some improvement of mood.  No adverse side effects were noted.  The patient had previously seen a counsellor at age 13, but only attended 4 or 5 sessions.  Not currently seeing a counsellor.  Current medications:  20mg qd  SUBSTANCE USE:  denies any substance use.  MEDICAL HISTORY: No significant medical history was reported.   FAMILY HISTORY: There appears to be a family history of mood issues. \u2019s mother reported that she has been on antidepressants since 2001 and that she attended sessions with  who the family reports is a Psychologist and currently sees Dr. , Psychiatrist. According to her mother, \u2019s father experiences very low moods. In addition, they reported that \u2019s paternal half brother experiences \u201cextreme anger\u201d and refused to attend school after grade eight.   SOCIAL HISTORY:  is in grade 12 at .  She reported that she is beginning to withdraw from her best friend  and does not open up to her about her feelings. When asked what  might see when  is upset, she was not sure but thought she might appear more standoffish.  did not endorse a conflictual pattern of relating with others.   FAMILY AND CARING SYSTEM:  lives with her mother and her younger brother. Her parents separated when she was 11 years old.  reported that her mother had cancer when  was 4, 6 and 8 years old.  described frequently worrying about her mother\u2019s physical and mental health and that she does not want to burden her mother with her problems. Unsurprisingly then,  reported that she does not open up about her feelings to her mother. She noted that she does not have a good relationship with her father and feels that he may have caused her to be perfectionistic as she felt that nothing she ever did was good enough for him. She described herself as being very sensitive to what her father thought and said about her.   MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION: Patient is an adolescent female, slightly overweight, appears stated age.  She was very talkative and pleasant, cooperative.  Speech was articulate.   exhibited full range.  Mood stable.  Thought form linear.  Thought content: no suicidal ideations, intent or plan.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  Judgment intact, insight adequate.  No gross cognitive deficits noted.    DIAGNOSIS (DSM-IV): AXIS I: \tGeneralized Anxiety Disorder \t\tSocial Phobia \t\tMajor Depressive Disorder, single  \t\tr/o Eating Disorder  AXIS II: \tnone known  AXIS III: \tnoncontributory  AXIS IV:\tFamilial issues (strained relationship with father, concern over mother\u2019s physical and mental health) \tSocial relationship issues (withdrawing from current best friend, questionable social support network) \tStress regarding transition to university  AXIS V:  \tGAF: 55   IMPRESSION/PLAN: 17 year-old female presents with anxiety and depressive symptoms within the context of what appears to be a developmental crisis, as the patient has been excessively worried about the future, specifically about making it to university after the 12th grade.  She meets criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and major depressive disorder.  It does appear that the patient has exhibited a partial response of her depressive episode to the initiation of fluoxetine.  Her suicide risk is low at this time, as the patient does not have a history of suicide attempts, substance abuse, or family history of suicide.  It appears that the anxiety symptoms are primary at this time, and these anxiety symptoms are affecting her psychosocial functioning including her mood.  Plan: 1)\tContinue fluoxetine 20mg qd for depressive symptoms. 2)\t to community clinic for individual or group CBT in the TAG program. 3)\t to clinic in 2 weeks for follow-up until the patient is transferred to the \tcommunity clinic.

  "content": "     Smith  Date: February 28, 2007.   is a 16 year old male who lives at home with his mother in .  He is currently in grade 11.  Please see the psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Kis for more detailed history.  In summary, patient was admitted after he had lacerated his arm, causing tendon injury and had lacerated his neck and requiring sutures.   stated he felt \"panicky\" and decided not to go to school yesterday.  s had suicidal intent yesterday, but today, he is glad to be alive.  Today, I met with patient, his mother, aunt and grandmother for an initial visit.   has exhibited a six-month history of functional decline, characterized by social isolation, erratic sleep patterns, disorganized thoughts, and declining school performance.   is usually very good in school, and last year was on the honor roll.   has never before seen a psychiatrist or a counselor, and up to six months ago was in a state of normal health and functioning.   did go to the emergency department two weeks ago, secondary to anxiety attacks.   has no prior psychiatric hospitalizations.  There is a family history of psychosis in the family.   was hospitalized the proximally five years ago for a psychotic episode in which she was paranoid, had mood swings, and an erratic sleep, appetite, and activity level.   was apparently prescribed antipsychotics while in the hospital, but she did not continue taking the medication when she was discharged.   states that she has been keeping herself stable for the past five years by focusing on good sleep patterns, adequate nutrition and healthy lifestyle choices.  He did report a history of racing thoughts, which oftentimes is the reason for his poor sleep patterns.  He ports difficulty concentrating, and has low energy level.  He states, school has been stressful recently, starting with finals in early January 2006, and also admits to having some problems with his girlfriend, whom he has been with for the past few years.   denies previous suicide attempts, and denies any previous self harm behaviors.  He did admit to you of using cannabis on an almost daily basis starting several months ago.  He states he initially used cannabis for fun, but then started using daily to try to address his emotional problems.  However, he admits that the cannabis eventually made his emotional state worse.      On mental status exam, patient was cooperative and pleasant.  He had good eye contact.  His speech was slow, yet articulate.  He was alert and oriented to person, place and time.   was blunted.  Mood was low.  Thought form exhibited some poverty of speech, and had increased latency when responding to questions.   had difficulty understanding questions at times and often had to repeat questions.  Also, patient's responses were inconclusive and vague at times.   did report auditory hallucinations, but could not elaborate on them.  He also admitted to paranoid thoughts, but again could not elaborate on them.    Impressions: the differential diagnosis is quite large at this time, which includes mood disorder versus a psychotic disorder.  In the past six months may have been a prodromal episode.  The family history of psychosis does illustrate patient\u2019s genetic vulnerability.   also has a history of cannabis abuse.  Plan: We will continue to gather collateral and longitudinal information to aid with diagnosis and treatment planning. .  Loxapine 50 mg q6h PRN agitation, psychosis, or severe anxiety.

Although he reports longstanding anxiety, it appears to be subtheshold, as it has not impacted his life significantly and he has methods to address it. He has experienced significant issues of loss of his relationship with his father, and the impact of coming out as bisexual. These stressors suggest that an interpersonal approach to psychotherapy may be helpful.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  The patient is an almost 13 year old male who is going in Grade 8 at .  REASON FOR REFERRAL:  The patient is not safe at home; he continues to have anger towards his mother.  He is currently living at .  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. Charlotte .  The patient had completed the Compass Program which ended in November, 2010.  The patient was placed in the Compass Program as he was exhibiting physical aggression towards his mother.  However, when the patient completed the Compass Program, he was not safe to return home as he continued to exhibit aggression towards his mother and therefore he was taken into DCS custody under voluntary care.  He was placed at the , and was subsequently transferred to the  and has been there for the past seven months.  This is a group home for boys aged 12-14 who have significant conduct behaviors.  Dr.  referred patient to me as he did not have follow up care when discharged from the Compass Program.  The patient was not assigned to a psychiatric despite being on multiple psychotropics for significant behavioral difficulties.   reports the patient has required mental health services since he was 2 years old.   was in the :  Tyler  July 21, 2011 Page 2  Help Program in the past.  The patient eventually got in to see  and Dr.  with Community Mental Health in  through the IWK.   Eventually the patient was involved in the FUNDS program with  and therefore patient was transitioned to the Compass Program due to physical aggression towards his mother.  The patient was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at the age of 8.  He had a trial of  which made him more aggressive and impulsive.  He was subsequently switched to Adderall which was not effective.   He was on  for approximately 1 \u00bd years as it was helpful in the beginning.  However  was eventually discontinued as patient became more aggressive and became more physically aggressive with his mother.  A trial of  caused worsening tics and irritability.  The patient was subsequently started on Adderall and  was added.  He was on this combination since , 2011.  The patient entered the Compass Program in May, 2010 and it ended in November, 2010.  The patient was not able to go home when he completed the Compass Program as he continued to exhibit violent behaviors.  Apparently the patient was fine at the Compass Program but was only aggressive at home.  However, mother stated that instead of patient fighting while at the Compass Program, he would become very frustrated and scratch himself.  On a positive note, since completing the Compass Program, the patient has not exhibited any violent behaviors towards his mother.  It appears that the patient is motivated to keep his outbursts under control so that he can return to live with his mother.  He currently visits his mother several days per week and apparently his visits there have been good.  The patient did not do well in Grade 7 as he missed a lot of school as he was suspended for disruptive behaviors.   states that patient is still unhappy, the patient still has outbursts but this does not occur daily and only occurs a couple of times per week.  Although patient states he does have low moods, these are not sustained.  He reports normal sleep patterns.  He does report decreased energy and decreased appetite and difficulty focusing.

IDENTIFYING INFORMATION:  The patient is a17 year old male who was previously living in a group home but recently moved back home with his parents.  He will be going into Grade 12 at .  REASON FOR REFERRAL:  Diagnostic clarification and psychiatric opinion.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient was referred for a psychiatric evaluation by Dr. , Pediatrician.  The patient was referred as Dr. Webster was requesting for diagnostic clarification and to inform the treatment plan.  The patient was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder combined type in 2004.  The patient was initially started on  and it was titrated to 90 mg qam.  It was not optimal therefore in 2008, the patient was switched to  20 mg tablets, one in the morning and one at lunch, along with Ritalin 10 mg tabs, one in the morning and 1-2 in the evening as needed.  It was in the summer of 2009 when he was caught smoking pot in his friend\u2019s home; the patient was switched to  XR and remained on this until the winter of 2009-2010.  In late 2009, the patient had feelings of sadness and anxiety.  He was subsequently referred to Dr.  in 2009.  Dr.  diagnosed patient with an anxiety disorder and depression.  Dr.  had recommended that the patient have  titrated to 100 mg daily and also suggested decreasing the  XR down to 30 mg.  However, the reduction of  did not occur as patient and his mother were reluctant to change as :   August 13, 2011 Page 2  patient was doing well on  for his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.   In mid April, 2010, the patient had good response to  making him much happier.  However, his grades started to decline again.  The patient was subsequently switched to  to a high dosage along with  in the afternoon as needed.  In late 2010, the patient was seeing , a psychologist, regularly.  During that time he was not going to school or to his job regularly.  The  dose was subsequently increased to 140 mg qam, however, it was felt not to be effective and therefore discontinued and the patient was switched to  XR 70 mg qam.  He also continued to take  75 mg qam.  In early 2011, the patient was asked to leave his parents\u2019 home due to his use of cannabis.  He apparently lived with his maternal grandparents first and then moved to a group home.   was subsequently discontinued and  was started and was titrated to 40 mg daily.  The patient underwent further medication changes and eventually the patient was also augmented with .  There was also a trial with low dose , but this was not effective and therefore discontinued.  The patient reports abusing cannabis approximately one year ago.  He previously saw psychologist  but then started seeing  at the Choices program in February, 2011.  The patient reports that his anxiety symptoms have not been properly addressed.  He continues to have generalized worries and is always thinking negative thoughts.  He is always fidgety and biting his nails.  He also has anxiety attacks characterized by shortness of breath, feeling sick, nauseous, and increased heart rate.  He also has performance anxiety and anticipatory anxiety.  Both patient and his mother believe that his anxiety symptoms have not been properly addressed and some of the treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder may in fact have worsened his anxiety symptoms.  During the last school year in Grade 11, the patient did fail some courses, so he does continue to have problems with focusing and completing school work.  However, the patient continues to have out of control anxiety symptoms.  The patient reports that his mood symptoms are under fair control.  He reports currently his main problem is with anxiety.  PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:     Please see History of Present Illness for the pharmacotherapy which has been managed by Dr. Webster.  The patient was previously in therapy with .  He started at Choices in February, 2011 with .  He last saw  approximately one month ago and reports he has a good connection with him.  However, the patient questions whether therapy at Choices has been effective as he continues to abuse cannabis.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   No acute medical problems.    CURRENT MEDICATION:     XR 70 mg qam.   60 mg qam.   50 mg daily.  ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies. :   August 13, 2011 Page 3  FAMILY HISTORY:   Maternal grandmother with depression.  Maternal aunt with depression.  Maternal aunt with anxiety.  Father with depression.  Maternal grandfather with alcoholism.  SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient was living at  for the past 4-5 months as he was kicked out of his mother\u2019s home earlier this year because of his drug abuse.  The patient was subsequently moved back into his mother\u2019s house this past week, as he has agreed to follow his parents\u2019 rules.  He is also volunteering at the  and  and runs groups for the kids there.  He still smokes cannabis daily, approximately 0.5 grams per day. MENTAL STATUS EXAM:   Patient was pleasant and cooperative during the interview.  He had good eye contact and did not exhibit any psychomotor changes.  His gait was grossly normal.  No abnormal body movements, no tics noted.  He was polite with the interviewer and his mother.  No disruptive behaviors noted.  He was alert and oriented.  Speech exhibited normal patterns.  His affect was euthymic.  Mood was stable.   form was logical.   content, denied suicidal ideations, denied homicidal ideations.  No signs or symptoms of psychosis or mania were noted.  IMPRESSION:   17 year old male with history and presentation consistent with Generalized  and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  He also has a history of depression but that is currently stable.  The patient has received high doses of stimulant treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; however these treatments at high doses may be worsening and exacerbating his anxiety symptoms.  Although the patient is on a high dose of an SSRI, it is likely that the high dose stimulants may be counteracting the anxiolytic effect of the SSRI.  Therefore, the first step should be to reduce the dose of his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder treatments and to target his anxiety symptoms as a primary target.  Once his anxiety symptoms are adequately treated, his focus and attention span may improve.  DIAGNOSIS:   I:   \tGeneralized .  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.   by  \t\thistory.  Cannabis abuse.  II:   \tDeferred  III:  \tNon contributory :   \tHad been living in a group home.  Some academic problems.  Primary  \t\tSupport.  V: \tGAF = 60  :   August 13, 2011 Page 4  PLAN:   Will decrease  XR to 40 mg qam as the high dose of  may be exacerbating his anxiety symptoms. Will continue  50 mg daily for now.  The target dosage for an anxiety disorder is  20-40 mg daily. Will continue  60 mg qam for combination treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Will consider tapering and discontinuing  in the future to obtain the patient\u2019s baseline symptoms. Return to clinic in one week for immediate follow up. I will manage the patient and stabilize him before returning the patient back to his paediatrician, Dr. .  The patient also stated he would continue to follow up with  at Choices to address substance abuse issues.  I explained to patient that his use of cannabis may be helping with his anxiety symptoms over the short term but overall, his cannabis use is a barrier to reduction to his overall psychiatric symptoms.       , MD, FAPA Board Certified Psychiatrist, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology ",
