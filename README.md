Mental healthcare faces 2 key challenges: psychiatric services remain inaccessible and unaffordable to the majority of the worldâ€™s population, and the quality of care is extremely subjective due to fragmented clinical methods. In this project, a deep learning and natural language processing based platform that is optimally able to provide a preliminary diagnosis with patient-personalized risk factors is designed and validated. Algorithmically, all training and testing of the diagnosis and risk factor predicting models was done on 2145 real de-identified patient cases obtained from a psychiatrist. An ensemble of customized models encompassed of novel adaptive data representation strategies, specifically, recurrent transfer-learning with distinct vectorizations, quantitative textual insight extraction, and dependency structures transformations, led to a 79% validation accuracy with 0.73 interrater reliability for risk factor predictions, whereas a unique combination of a models trained on textually rendered network graphs and deep contextualized word embeddings led to a 74% validation accuracy with 0.66 interrater reliability for diagnosis predictions. Individually, novel optimization methods employing genetic algorithms for variable subset selection in the risk-factor ensemble, and arbitrary lambda layers for regularization in the diagnosis ensemble, saw to an average increase in individual model performance of 145% and 160%, respectively. An additional novel corpus extension strategy is also presented, that extrapolates from the limited dataset and provides an average 122% performance increase in both ensembles. With these models fully integrated into a user-friendly web application, the software is able to serve as a virtual psychiatrist by employing a decision tree of possible questions, answers to which are contextually required for the models to compute their prediction, and video/audio capabilities that allow it to seamlessly interact with a given patient, and vice-versa, enhanced by pre-trained facial emotion and speech sentiment capturing models. These results, packaged into this software have the potential to significantly improve mental healthcare prognosis by successfully providing primary care workers and nurse practitioners with expert-level insights, thereby increasing access to quality psychiatric services in an affordable and standardized format.
