I'm just really low all the time, have negative thoughts and feelings towards just everything in my life. I just feel clogged - everything is meaningless. I've been experiencing this for about 2 months. I'm a part-time student. I live with my mum. I just dont feel like putting in the effort. I do feel more alone that ever these days, not functioning at all. I have no energy. I may become a lawyer someday, but I cant figure out anything. I'm eating more sugar these days actually...eating twice a day + lots of sugar snacks. I easily sleep 8 or 9 hours most days. I used to like my life, and even though I'm pretty low all the time, I still wanna live. Last winter around the same time I felt pretty low. I'm the only person in my family that has mental health problems.
